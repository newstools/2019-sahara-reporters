Ike Ekweremadu, a former Deputy President of the Senate, has called on the President Muhammadu Buhari regime to severe diplomatic ties with South Africa. Ekeweremadu said this on Twitter while reacting to the latest Xenophobic attacks on Nigerians in South Africa. He said: “I find the incessant xenophobic attacks on Nigerians and other African nationals in South Africa very un-African, barbaric, and unparalleled acts of ingratitude. It is quite disturbing that the government of South Africa has not taken decisive steps to end these attacks, which have led to a wanton loss of lives and properties of fellow Africans, especially Nigerians. “The attacks defy and desecrate everything African brotherhood stands for, especially for a country that gained freedom with the support, sweat, and sacrifice of fellow African nations among which Nigeria clearly stands out. The attacks have reached scary and desperate degrees and call for desperate actions on the part of Nigeria, other African nations, and the African Union. “It will, therefore, not be out of place for the federal government to suspend diplomatic relations with SA until full assurance of the safety of Nigerians and their properties in South African are secured, adequate compensation paid for the damages, and the perpetrators also brought to book. “The AU should, therefore, summon an emergency session to sanction South Africa; and a suspend from the Union for unprovoked acts of hostilities against fellow Africans whose countries fought for the freedom they enjoy today will not be out of place.”
