Apostle Johnson Suleman Senior Pastor of Omega Fire Ministry, Apostle Johnson Suleman, has offered to airlift more Nigerians willing to come back home from South Africa. Some Nigerians were on Wednesday evacuated from South Africa over the recent xenophobic attacks in the country. The Air Peace flight, which evacuated them on Wednesday, arrived the Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos at exactly 9:35pm. Reacting to the development in a tweet via his verified Twitter handle @APOSTLESULEMAN, the clergyman said; “Just heard 900 Nigerians want to return home from South Africa. “I have asked for flight tickets to be bought for 20 Nigerians in South Africa who want to return home. I will take care of the cost. “Please register at our church in Johannesburg, we will airlift more by God’s grace. God keep you all alive.”
