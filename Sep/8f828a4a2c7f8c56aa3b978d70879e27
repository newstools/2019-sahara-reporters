An Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court in Lagos on Friday sentenced a 22-year-old engineer, Kelvin Obinna, to six months in prison with hard labour for refusing to pay a N2.4m bill he incurred in a night club during his birthday celebration, the News Agency Of Nigeria reports. Obinna pleaded guilty to two counts of breach of peace and obtaining goods under false pretences. Chief Magistrate A.A. Fashola sentenced Obinna without an option of fine. Earlier, the prosecution counsel, Sgt. Michael Unah, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on August 31 at 10:00pm at number 113 Obafemi Awolowo Way, Ikeja.

He added that the owner of the club, Mr Success God, reported the case to the police.
