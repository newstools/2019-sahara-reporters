A group made up of ex-Niger Delta agitators, Coast Guard of the Federation, has expressed readiness to storm South Africa to defend and protect Nigerians still trapped in the former apartheid country. Commandant-General of the group, Bibi Oduku, disclosed this on Monday in Abuja in a statement. He said that over 2,000 Coast Guard officers and 10,000 ex-militants were on standby to invade South Africa if the situation degenerated to war. He stated that the group was only waiting for an order from President Muhammadu Buhari and the Chief of Army Staff, Tukur Buratai, to act. Oduku said, “At least 2,000 Coast Guard officers are waiting for President Buhari and the Chief of Army Staff to give the nod and they will be in South Africa to ensure that no Nigerian is further harassed, molested or killed. “Over 10,000 ex-militants have also pledged their readiness to go to South Africa as foot soldiers if the situation degenerates to war. “We know that our army is more than ready to tackle any aggression from any country, our service is only to compliment that.”
