 Director-General of the National Youth Service Corp, Brig. General Shuaibu Ibrahim, has warned serving corps members to avoid careless usage of the social media in order not to endanger their service year. Ibrahim sounded the warning on Thursday when he visited the 2019 Batch B (Stream II) members at the Orientation Camp, Ikare Akoko, Ondo State. He said corps members should not ridicule what NYSC stands for by misinforming the world through "unguarded use of the social media". He said, “You should not because of the surmountable challenges you are facing at a particular time destroy the laudable scheme which the Federal Government has invested huge resources in to attract negative statements on the social media. “As a nation, we know that we are passing through challenges. NYSC wants you participate in the programme so that you can proffer solutions and not to add more burden to its existence by using the social media negatively. “Our administration has vowed to deal ruthlessly with recalcitrant corps members who put our corporate identity to disrepute by dressing shabbily, casually and inappropriately.”
