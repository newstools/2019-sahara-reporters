Xenophobic attacks in South Africa
NAN The Centre for Human Rights Civic Education has urged the Nigerian Government to go beyond mere talking and act in response to xenophobic attacks on Nigerians and other African migrants in South Africa. The group, while condemning the development, urged the government to immediately pass a strong message of its irritation at the situation by expelling the South African envoy in Abuja as a first symbolic step. Executive Director of CHRICED, Dr Ibrahim Zikirullahi, while calling on the Nigerian Government to immediately review diplomatic relations with South Africa, said that the era of African brotherhood with the former apartheid nation was over. He said, “Nigeria must invoke the principle of reciprocity by mobilising its soft power assets to put pressure on South African economic interests in Nigeria, in the first instance. “It is totally unacceptable that South Africans are killing Nigerians and attacking their businesses while South African businesses thrive in other parts of the continent. “If Nigeria could selflessly launch and sustain decades-long campaign to help free South Africa from the dehumanising clutches of apartheid, it must be prepared to go all the way to protect the lives and dignity of its citizens from irredeemable xenophobes.”
