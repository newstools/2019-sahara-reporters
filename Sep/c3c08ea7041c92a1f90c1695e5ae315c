The Joint Action Movement Against Xenophobia has urged the South African police to end attacks on foreign nationals in the country. The group said this following a rally over the weekend to condemn the recent xenophobic attacks in South Africa. Some viral videos on social media showed the country's cops watching as South African xenophobes destroyed foreigners' properties and businesses. The group in a statement signed by its Convener, Senator Khalid Sunusi Kani, noted that reprisals and cutting international ties would not put an end to the killings. The group said, “Identification and supervision of migration to the countries by enacting a law or treaty that will regulate such legally. “Orientation of security agencies to know their works and not supporting illegal act as seen in South Africa and bringing the perpetrators and culprits behind the bar for proper adjudication.”
