The Presidential Election Tribunal sitting in Abuja on Wednesday struck out the application of the All Progressives Congress accusing the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, of being a Cameroonian. Justice Garba MohammedÂ warned the APC not to divert the attention of the court because Atiku was qualified to contest the February 2019 presidential election being a Nigerian. The judge said that the former Vice President of Nigeria was not from the Northern part of Cameroon as claimed by the APC.
