 Jim Ovia, Chairman of Zenith Bank Plc, has withdrawn from the ongoing World Economic Forum (WEF) holding in South Africa. Jim Ovia, who was already at the event, said he was withdrawing following criticisms from Nigerians. "Following the hypersensitivity of the issues surrounding the lives and well-being of Nigerian citizens living in South Africa and to contribute his voice against the poor state of security regarding foreign nationals living in Africa, the Founder/Chairman of Zenith Bank Plc, Mr Jim Ovia has withdrawn from further activities at the World Economic Forum Africa 2019, taking place in Cape Town, South Africa," Ovia said in a statement released on Thursday. The statement added, "Before taking his exit, Mr. Ovia stressed the need for youth empowerment and better government policies to curb continual attacks on persons living within and outside Africa. He belaboured that until positive change towards collective growth happens on this front, the continent would not reach its potential. "Mr. Ovia added that full support should be rendered in vocational education of the young persons living in not just Nigeria but Africa. According to him, the Jim Ovia Foundation has taken up a stance on this issue, has empowered over 3,500 students and entrepreneurs since its inception. He called on other members of the private sector to join hands and solve this menace plaguing the African continent." Oby Ezekwesili, the convener of the Bring Back Our Girls Movement, was also condemned for participating in the summit. The Nigerian government boycotted the event as well as recalled its ambassador to South Africa.
