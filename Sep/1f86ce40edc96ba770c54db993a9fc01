 The Website of the Nigeria Police Force as suddenly become unresponsive at the time the Nation is embroiled in reprisal violence following the recent Xenophobic attack against Nigerians in South Africa. SaharaReporters observed that the website failed to load on Wednesday. As of 12 noon on Tuesday, the website was running but has now become unresponsive. An experienced website developer, who preferred not to be named as his company does not allow him to give public comment, told SaharaReporters that this could mean the police website was hosted on a cheap server that could not accommodate visits to it in recent time. The situation will likely make it impossible for Nigerians to get up-to-date information regarding pockets of violence in the country. The IT expert added that it could be the police intentionally restricted the website. All attempts to reach Frank Mba, the police spokesperson, was unsuccessful as he did not pick telephone calls made to him.
