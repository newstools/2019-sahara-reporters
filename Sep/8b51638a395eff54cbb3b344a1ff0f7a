 A human rights activist, Ayomide Oluwaremilekun Oseni, has uploaded what he described as his obituary picture on social media. Oseni said it was necessary to do so in anticipation that he might die in the hands of President Muhammadu Buhari-sanctioned security agents who would likely want to prevent the proposed September 18 #RevolutionNow open-air symposium slated to hold in Nigeria and other places. The Nigerian activist was arrested last August and remained in detention for almost two weeks for staging a one-man protest at the National Stadium in Surulere. "In case Muhammadu Buhari, @MBuhari decides to kill us again on September 18, 2019, and I die...This is my obituary picture, I died a revolutionist...#RevolutionNow #FreeSowore #RevolutionIsNow #RevolutionProtest," he tweeted @Daddy_aoo.
