 A Federal High Court in Ikoyi, Lagos has remanded two men who allegedly broke into a sealed warehouse and stole substandard electric cables confiscated by the Standards Organisation of Nigeria. The suspects are Chukwuma Nwodo, 31, and Abor Ikechukwu, 21. Justice Nicholas Oweibo on Thursday made the order following their arraignment on a two-count charge of conspiracy, unlawful destruction of SON seal and stealing. Babatunde Alajogun, who represented the Attorney-General of the Federation, told the judge that the defendants committed the offences on or about August 21, 2019, at a warehouse behind Bengass Motor Park, Ojo-Alaba. He said, “They conspired to destroy the seal of the Standards Organisation of Nigeria which was used to seal up the warehouse containing substandard cables using welding equipment.” The offences, the prosecutor added, contravened Sections 3(a) and 3(6) of the Miscellaneous Offences Act, 2004 and punishable under Section 3(a) of the same Act. However, Nwodo and Ikechukwu pleaded not guilty. The judge ordered for the two men to be remanded in prison custody and adjourned the matter until October 24 for trial.
