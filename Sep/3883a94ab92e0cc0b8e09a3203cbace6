Femi Fani-Kayode, a former Minister of Aviation, has called on the Nigerian government to do more than just boycott the World Economic Summit. The former minister, who is also answering criminal charges on money laundering, said the President Muhammadu Buhari regime must make sure that South Africa pay for its “insolence and barbarity”. Fani-Kayode said this via his Twitter handle while commending the steps taken so far by the government. "I commend the FG and @MBuhari for boycotting the World Economic Forum. When it comes to the South African matter we must set our differences aside and stand as one. The FG has taken a good first step but must do far more. South Africa must pay dearly for her insolence and barbarity!” he tweeted. President Muhammdu Buhari boycotted the WES following an intense call by Nigerians for the government to act decisively on the xenophobic attacks against Nigerians living in South Africa. The government has also recalled its ambassador to South Africa. Nigerian businesses and that of other African nationals were looted by angry South African who claimed foreigners are taking up their jobs. These attacks have led to reprisals on various South African brands across other African countries.
