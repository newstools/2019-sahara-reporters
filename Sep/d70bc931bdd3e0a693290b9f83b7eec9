There are strong indications that the Economic and Financial CrimesCommission has abandoned the hunt for the Chairman of the defunctPension Reform Task Team, Abdulrasheed Maina, indicted for N2.1billion pension biometric scam.Punch reports that the EFCC lost interest in the case following theofficial protection enjoyed by the ex-director who was also promotedafter his controversial reinstatement into the civil service byPresident Muhammadu Buhari’s government in 2017.Sources said the anti-graft body had abandoned the search for Maina,noting that “he is more or less a free man now.”The newspaper quoted a source as saying, “Is anyone talking aboutMaina again? He is no longer a fugitive and the EFCC has abandoned thehunt for him. If you are in doubt, ask Ibrahim Magu (acting EFCCChairman) for an update on his case and hear what he would tell you.”The EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, said there was no update on themanhunt for the former director.Maina was reportedly nursing a governorship ambition to rule his homestate of Borno when he fled the country after he was declared wantedby the anti-graft agency in 2013.He fled to the United Arab Emirates where he hibernated for threeyears until he was said to have met with the Attorney General of theFederation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, in Dubai, in2016, during which he was reportedly assured of his safety in Nigeria.Shortly after this, Maina’s name was reportedly taken off the watchlist at the nation’s international airports and he had been visitingthe country more regularly from his foreign base.The former PRTT chairman was being protected from arrest andprosecution by top officials in the Presidency and the Ministry ofJustice and that while placed on the International Police wanted list,he was always in the country hobnobbing with senior officials, it wasreported.A source claimed that Maina was “a friend of the government, noenforcement agency would dare take him into custody.”Malami had in November 2017 admitted before a senate ad hoc panelprobing Maina’s reinstatement into the civil service that he met withthe former PRTT boss in Dubai.Sequel to this, Maina resumed at the Ministry of Interior where he waspromoted as Director, Human Resources Department, without sitting themandatory promotion examination.Against the backdrop of the revelations, Buhari ordered the sacking ofthe director and the Senate also set up an ad-hoc committee todetermine the circumstances that led to the return of Maina to thecountry and his reinstatement into the service despite being on thesecurity watch list.But the report of the committee headed by the then Chairman, SenateCommittee on Establishments and Public Services, Senator EmmanuelPaulker (PDP, Bayelsa Central), was not released till the tenure ofthe eight Senate lapsed.Maina in January 2019, secured a court order stopping the EFCC fromdeclaring him wanted.Justice Giwa Ogunbanjo of the Federal High Court described the actionof the anti-graft agency in declaring Maina wanted as unlawful, butthe commission vowed to appeal against the order.When asked if the commission had appealed the court order obtained byMaina against his arrest, the EFCC spokesman pleaded with Punch fortime to find out from the commission’s director of the legaldepartment.He later said he could not reach the director as calls to his phone rang out.Checks, however, showed that  Maina is still listed as a wanted personon EFCC's website.
