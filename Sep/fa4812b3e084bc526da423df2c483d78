 The Private Telecommunications and Communications Senior Staff Association of Nigeria and its MTN Branch have called on the governments of Nigeria and South Africa to explore all diplomatic means to end the violence against Nigerians in South Africa and reprisal in Nigeria. In a statement on Thursday, the association described the violence in both countries as unfortunate and disturbing, adding that it should be nipped in the bud before it destroys the age-long relations between both countries. The statement signed by PTECSSAN General Secretary, Okonu Abdullahi, and PTECSSAN MTN Branch, Elisha Adamu, urged the government to take immediate steps against organisers and perpetrators of these attacks on Nigerians and other Africans in the country. The association said, “We understand the pain and frustration of our people because of xenophobia in South Africa but we must not as a people succumb to the temptation of reprisal as this will be tantamount to stooping so low to the level of the South Africans. “We must know that any reprisal is uncivilised and will be counterproductive, hence, condemnable. “Workers in MTN Nigeria and other businesses of South African origin are Nigerians not South Africans. “Therefore, those involved in the reprisal must have a rethink and refrain from further attack in the interest of our economy and wellbeing. “It is irrational for Nigerians to attack Nigerians, their means and places of livelihood. “Nigeria is currently battling with a high rate of unemployment and any act capable of worsening the situation must be condemned, discouraged and resisted by all and sundry.”
