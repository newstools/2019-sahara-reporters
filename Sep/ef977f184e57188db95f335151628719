Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, has thrown his weight behindRivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, over the alleged demolition of amosque in Port Harcourt.The chairman of the Nigerian Governors’ Forum on Sunday after visitingthe site in the dispute said he could not see any evidence that Wikedemolished any mosque in the city.Fayemi stated following the inspection, “With what I’ve seen, I cannotsee any evidence of any building that has been demolished here."If you (Wike) are somebody who wants a place of worship, you shouldfind a way to oblige them. I know within your capacity, it’ll bepossible to find a place for them."From what I’ve seen here, I think it is a storm in a teacup. There isnothing to warrant this kind of media hype that has been given to it,”Fayemi said.Wike, who conducted Fayemi around the disputed site, stated: “I wantto thank the chairman of my forum for at least coming to see thingsfor himself. He called me while he was away and I told him, you knowthat I can’t do something like that and he said okay when he comesback, he is coming to see me and he has fulfilled that promise."That shows leadership, and from what he has seen, there was nomosque. There is no way I’ll see a mosque and order the Ministry ofUrban Development to go and demolish a mosque.“Assuming that there is even a mosque and that government doesn’t wantit at that location, we’ll invite them and say look, we don’t want amosque there, can we find you an alternative place?"But there was no mosque. I don’t know why people should make politicsout of the issue. It’s not important,” Wike explained.
