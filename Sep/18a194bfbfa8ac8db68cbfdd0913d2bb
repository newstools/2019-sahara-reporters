  The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ), has bemoaned theshutdown of internet services across the world, especially in Africa.The body which is based in Brussels Belgium also accused the Belgiangovernment of hindering access to information in 2019.“We are witnessing how governments use excuses of all kinds to preventcitizens' free access to information,” Anthony Bellanger, IFJ’sgeneral secretary said.“On the International Day for Universal Access to Information, we wantto condemn those governments who block the free access to informationand internet and call on them to adopt information laws that guaranteeand protect this access. This is a non-negotiable right in anydemocratic system”.The IFJ notes that 31 countries have so far used internet restrictionsto curb free speech and a right to information in 2019.According to the organisation, internet shutdown is not the only formof repression that has been used against the media in recent times.
