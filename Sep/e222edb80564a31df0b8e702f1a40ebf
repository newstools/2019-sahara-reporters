Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir el-Rufai, has enrolled his son in a public primary school in Kaduna. The six-year-old boy, Abubakar Al-Siddique, was enrolled at Kaduna Capital School. The governor disclosed this on his Twitter account on Monday, adding that the act was in fulfilment of a promise he made in 2017. He said, “I will by personal example ensure that my son that will be six years of age in 2019 will be enrolled in a public school in Kaduna State, by God’s grace.” The state government said that the governor enrolled his son in a public school to boost people's confidence in the state's education system. “Reforming the education sector in Kaduna is a continuing struggle against decades of neglect. “But the @elrufai government has a strong commitment to fix public education and raise the standard of public schools so that private education will become only a luxury,” the state government said.
