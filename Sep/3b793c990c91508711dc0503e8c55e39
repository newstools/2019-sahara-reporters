Nigerians, who protested at the South African High Commission in Abuja on Thursday, have called on President Muhammadu Buhari to send the Acting South African High Commissioner, Bobby Moroe, packing from the country. The protesters said that recalling Nigerian Ambassador was not enough in drawing the red line with South Africa. They asked the President to do more by severing the relationship between both countries to send a strong message about Nigeria’s displeasure over the attacks of its citizens in South Africa. According to one of the leaders of the protest, Emmanuel Ogbeche, there is no moral justification for Moroe to remain in the country after the treatment meted out to Nigerians. He said, “We will go blind if we do not act and we commend the Nigerian Government for what it has done by recalling our High Commissioner in South Africa. “We appeal and demand from you to expel the South African High Commissioner back to his country.” Ogbeche also called on the European Union to launch a probe into human rights abuses perpetrated by the attackers and their sponsors. He added, “The UN and African Union should wake up to its responsibilities. The South African Government should be held accountable to the hundreds of lives that have been lost.”
