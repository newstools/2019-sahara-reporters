The United States might seem divided over President Donald Trump'spolicies, but overseas, the American president is loved.According to the data from the Pew Research Centre, Nigerians'confidence in Trump to do the right thing regarding world affairs wasat 59 percent in 2018, higher than some points during the Obamaadministration.Also, Nigerians are in top five of those actively following Trump onTwitter, a social media platform constantly used by the president,Monti Datta, associate professor of political science from theUniversity of Richmond, claimed.“Some of Trump's foreign policies in Nigeria might explain hisrelative popularity. In February 2017, President Trump approved thesale of jet fighters to the Nigerian government, reversing a policyfrom the Obama administration."This aided the Nigerian government in its campaign against BokoHaram,” Datta said.The professor also listed South Korea and Israel as countries whereTrump’s policies seem to be enjoying the most public support.“And data from Gallup's Korean headquarters illustrate thatfavorability toward Trump among South Koreans has more than doubled,from a paltry 9 percent in 2017 to a high of 32 percent in 2018,” hesaid about South Korea.“As in the case of Nigeria and South Korea, Trump's popularity inIsrael seems to be a reversal of his predecessor."Frosty personal relations plagued Obama and Netanyahu, beginning withObama's first major foreign policy address to the Arab world in Cairoin 2009. This culminated in Netanyahu's visit to Congress in 2015 whenhe urged Congress to oppose the Iran nuclear agreement.”
