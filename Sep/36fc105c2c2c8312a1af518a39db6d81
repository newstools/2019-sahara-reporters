Citizens Advocacy for Social and Economic Rights (CASER) has described the perpetrators of xenophobic attacks on Nigerians in South Africa as a generation of "ungrateful and depraved" South Africans. Nigeria was instrumental in ending Apartheid, a system that perpetuated the enslavement of blacks, in the southern African country. CASER stated this on Tuesday in a statement. The Executive Director of CASER, Frank Tietie, said: “The action is necessary to prevent more Nigerians from losing their lives in the xenophobic attack, which the South Africans are currently carrying out on Nigerians living in that country. “They must immediately stop the South Africa enslavement of the satellite TV space of Nigeria by refusing to renew their subscriptions. “The Nigerian Attorney General of the Federation must immediately commence proper legal proceedings at the proper forum to seek compensation for all Nigerian victims of the perennial and irresponsible xenophobic attacks by this generation of ungrateful and depraved South Africans. “Where necessary, the AGF should not hesitate to further institute proper actions to seek sanctions against identified South Africans under the present International Criminal Law regime."
