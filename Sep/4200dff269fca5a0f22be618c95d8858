The operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) today (Monday) manhandled and dragged Omoyele Sowore out of the courtroom of a federal high court in Abuja. The rash and harsh action of the secret police was to prevent the rights activist from speaking with journalists present in the courtroom. Sowore had told the journalists that Nigerians should remain resolute and speak truth to power, adding that Nigerians should not allow selfish leaders to mortgage their lives. But suddenly, the armed DSS operatives dragged Sowore, preventing from granting an interview to the journalists. As he was dragged out the courtroom, Sowore was heard saying, "Revolution now! Revolution now!" He was eventually dragged out through the back door of the courtroom.
