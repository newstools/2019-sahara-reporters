  Olawale Bakare popularly called Mandate has said that he will continue to remain resolute despite being manhandled by operatives of the Department of State Services. Mandate, who is a 21-year-old student, was arrested on August 5, 2019 for participating in #RevolutionNow protest in Osogbo, Osun State, against bad governance in Nigeria. Mandate said, “It has been horrible and I have been treated badly but I am strong and I know that I will overcome in the end. “I want my family to know that I am alright. I have not been allowed access to anyone but I think about them and I want to let them know that I am fighting for the soul of Nigeria and for my future.”
