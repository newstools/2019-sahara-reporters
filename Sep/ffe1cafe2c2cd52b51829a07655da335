Senator Shehu Sani has criticised President Muhammadu Buhari’s government for clamping down on musicians from the Northern part of Nigeria critical of his administration. In June 2019, a musician, Mohammed Yusuf, was jailed for singing songs ridiculing Kano State governor, Abdullahi Ganduje. Condemning the situation in a post on Twitter, Sani said, “There is a growing trend of persecution of musicians and artists in the North who use their songs to criticise bad governance or question authorities; while those who sing the praises of those in power are patronised and glorified. This stands condemned.”
