Legal practitioner, Festus Keyamo, has been redeployed to the Ministry of Labour and Employment. His redeployment comes about one month after being named as Minister of State for Niger Delta Affairs. A statement from the Director of Information at the Office of Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Willie Bassey, said Keyamo would replace Tayo Alasoadura as the Minister of State for Labour, while Alasoadura went the other way. The statement said President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the swap. It said, “President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the immediate redeployment of two Ministers of State as follows. “Mr Festus Keyamo, Minister of State for Niger Delta Affairs, is to move to Ministry of Labour and Employment as Minister of State. “Senator Tayo Alasoadura is to move to the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs as Minister of State. “This redeployment takes effect from today, September 24, 2019."
