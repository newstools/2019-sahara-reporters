Eight people have been confirmed dead as armed men raided a community in Ebonyi State. On Saturday, the armed men stormed Ukwagba, Mgbo, Ohaukwu Local Government Area (LGA) of the state leaving four people beheaded. While the residents noted that they were attacked by villagers from Agila in neighbouring Benue State, government officials blamed the community. Loveth Odah, the police spokesperson in the state, told News Agency of Nigeria that in the attack which occurred on Saturday, four of the victims were beheaded. “The state Commissioner of Police, Awosola Awotinde, top police officers and the Chairman of Ohaukwu LGA, rushed to the scene on receiving information on the incident. “We were informed by the people that the attackers came from neighbouring Agila community of Benue as they also burnt six houses and killed 20 goats,” Odah said. According to the police, the beheaded victims are James Aleke, 55, Innocent Agbo, 65, Chukwu Enwe, 46, and Livinus Idoko, 70. Other residents killed include Ngozi Idenyi, 32, Jonathan Onwe, 10, Ify Aleke, 51, and Susanna Ogba, 54, while one Okeh Nwankwo, 53, is currently hospitalized. Meanwhile, the police commissioner urged the people to remain calm and avoid undertaking reprisals as the command will ensure that peace is restored in the area. However, the state governor, David Umahi, during a visit to the area on Sunday criticized stakeholders in the area for allowing the killings to continue. Umahi, who was represented by his deputy, Kelechi Igwe, said, “You should know the people causing trouble in your domains as the traditional rulers should be able to identify those fomenting trouble in the area. “We are tired of the sentiments coming from this council but seek action because some people wrote an undertaking to the state government, to ensure peace.”
