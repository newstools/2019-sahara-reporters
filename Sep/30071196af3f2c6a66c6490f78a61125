Malaria Could Eliminated By 2050Malaria could be wiped out as early as 2050 with the right tools,enough funding and sufficient political will power, according toscientists.One of the world’s oldest diseases, there are over 200 million malariacases each year and the disease claims almost half a million lives.Young children are most vulnerable to the disease, with those underthe age of five accounting for 61% of the deaths.Now a new report – Malaria eradication within a generation: Ambitious,achievable, and necessary – says the complete eradication of thedisease is within reach.The Lancet Commission on malaria eradication was set up in 2017 inpartnership with the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) toinvestigate how to stamp out the disease.Authored by 41 malariologists, biomedical scientists, economists, andhealth policy experts, it found the global incidence of malaria hasdropped by 36% since 2000.It also found fatalities had fallen by 60% in the last three years,but that progress had stalled in the last three years.Investment by governments and donors to tackle the disease have alsoplateaued, peaking at 4.3 billion US dollars (£3.5 billion) in 2016.While more than half of the world’s countries are now free frommalaria, the study found there has been a rise in malaria cases in 55countries across Africa, Asia, and Latin America.The research found that the large majority of new cases were recordedin 29, mostly African countries, with Nigeria and the DemocraticRepublic of Congo accounting for 36% of global cases.The report’s authors are now calling for a package of tools, policyinitiatives and funding to try and stamp out the disease.They propose a three-point plan to “bend the curve” in the fightagainst malaria, including making better use of current malariacontrol programmes.Secondly, the scientists want to see the development of new tools,vaccines, and drugs to fight the disease, as well as a funding boostof two billion US dollars (£1.6 billion) to put the plan into action.They argue that by wiping out malaria, it would overcome the problemof “relentless evolution” of drug resistance by the disease andinsecticide resistance by mosquitoes.The social and economic benefits to countries where malaria is commonwould greatly exceed the cost, the report said.Sir Richard Feacham, a co-chair of The Lancet’s commission on malariaeradication, said: “For too long, malaria eradication has been adistant dream, but now we have evidence that malaria can and should beeradicated by 2050.”Sir Richard, who is the director of the Global Health Group at UCSF,added: “To achieve this common vision, we simply cannot continue withbusiness as usual approach.“The world is at a tipping point, and we must instead challengeourselves with ambitious targets and commit to the bold action neededto meet them.”Dr. Winnie Mpanju-Shumbusho, a co-chair of the commission and a boardmember of the RBM Partnership to End Malaria, said: “Despiteunprecedented progress, malaria continues to strip communities aroundthe world of promise and economic potential, UK Press Associationreports.“This is particularly true in Africa, where just five countriesaccount for nearly half of the global burden.“Malaria eradication is a public health and equity imperative of ourgeneration.”
