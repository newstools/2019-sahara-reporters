The Nigerian government has summoned the South African High Commissioner to Nigeria, Bobby Moroe, over the recent xenophobic attacks on Nigerians. Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, made the call on Tuesday and scheduled a meeting to hold today. Onyema had on Monday vowed that the Nigerian government would take decisive measures following the xenophobic attacks on Nigerians and their businesses in South Africa. He described the news of the attack as "sickening and depressing". "Received sickening and depressing news of continued burning and looting of Nigerian shops and premises in #SouthAfrica by mindless criminals with ineffective police protection. Enough is enough. We will take definitive measures. @NigeriaGov @DigiCommsNG @GovernmentZA @DIRCO_ZA," he tweeted on Monday.
