Against the backdrop of alleged planned impeachment of the Speaker ofthe Bayelsa State House of Assembly, Tonye Emmanuel Isenah, lawmakers– both those loyal to the speaker and those loyal to Governor SeriakeDickson, have deserted the assembly solely to forestall crisis thatmay arise from their actions.Isenah, who was elected on June as the speaker of the state assembly,is under intense pressure from Governor Dickson to resign his positionor face impeachment to pave way for a lawmaker from Southern Ijawlocal government to take over, in order to help his party, the PeoplesDemocratic Party (PDP), win the area, Daily Trust reports.It was also alleged that the speaker, who is a critical member ofDickson’s led restoration caucus of the Bayelsa PDP, the family thatproduced the party’s governorship candidate, Senator Douye Diri, hadlast month refused the directive to commence impeachment process onthe deputy governor, Rear Admiral John Jonah (retd) and that was whenhis predicament started.The assembly sat last for normal legislative business on September 13,2019, before the crisis started, since then, an attempt by theleadership of the house to sit has always been thwarted due toinability of members to turn up to form a quorum.Isenah, who is said to be fully backed by opposition members of theHouse, had convened a sitting last Monday to announced a long recesstill after the governorship election, but lawmakers did not turn up,even on September 25, 2019, the speaker also convened an emergencysitting for 10 am, but members could not turn up, even when thespeaker was spotted in the assembly premises around 10:45 am, anddrove out after spending about fifteen minutes at his office.When Daily Trust visited the state Assembly complex, the tension washigh, the staff of the assembly were seen discussing the crisis in thehouse. No lawmaker was in the office, while visitors and journalistswere subjected to thorough security checks at the entrance.Since the impasse started, lawmakers hardly go to the office; nocommittee sitting, no oversight function, the assembly complex isgenerally calm and quiet compared to what it used to be.It was learnt that lawmakers loyal to the governor had been mobilizedto carry out an impeachment proceeding against Isenah, who hadinsisted that his resignation would not add any value to the PDP’squest to win the November 16 election.But, an insider in the assembly told Daily Trust Saturday that themajor hindrance at the moment for the lawmakers loyal to the governorto carry out the impeachment is the mace, which he said had gonemissing since the crisis started.Also, some external forces, powered by the opposition, are planning toprotect Isenah to enable him to retain his office. The APC has aboutfour lawmakers in the assembly, who are said to be against the move toremove the speaker, whom they described as a good fellow, and so theymay possibly stand against any motion to impeach the speaker.The speaker was said to have reached a compromise with Dickson and PDPleaders in the state to relinquish his office in the event thatSenator Douye Diri, who hails from his Kolokuma-Opokuma LocalGovernment Area, wins the November 16 governorship election.But after Diri won the primaries, PDP leaders were said to havepersuaded Isenah to resign from his position to pave way for alawmaker from Southern Ijaw local government to emerge in order forthe party to garner votes from the council. But Isenah is insisting hewould not let go of his position before the poll.The speaker in his Facebook post and later a statement by his mediaaide, Mr. Aotendeike Boloigha, said he had served the PDP faithfullyand was yet to see how his resignation would help the party in thepoll.He said: “My stand on the issue of resignation has been that I haveserved the party, PDP and Governor Seriake Dickson faithfully and willnot resign as doing so at this time will not in any way help the partysucceed in the November 16 governorship election.“I call on my teaming supporters to distance themselves from makingunnecessary statements and posts in the social media. When the needarises, I will make an official statement on my stands.”Dickson, during a media chat yesterday dispelled any plan to impeachthe speaker or force him to resign from his position, saying that theAssembly is stable and united.Dickson, who had earlier in the day inaugurated a 10-member PDP peaceand reconciliation committee headed by Senator Inatimi Spiff, said inpolitics, there must be minor disagreements and misunderstandings, butit takes an experienced leader to handle such situation.He said: “The speaker is a very promising young politician and Ibelieve he has a great future, the assembly is stable and united, butbecause I’m not a member of that assembly, I won’t say more, thespeaker is in the better position to say more.“You know in politics we have minor disagreements andmisunderstandings, but we have experience on how we react and handlethese things. We have a very wonderful House of Assembly and theleadership and members are doing very well.”A PDP source said Isenah’s travails were based on his refusal toinitiate an impeachment proceeding against the Deputy Governor, RearAdmiral John Jonah (retd).“It is not just about an agreement to step down; it is about thedeputy governor. The powers that be accused the deputy governor ofplanning to defect to the All Progressives Congress (APC) as anincumbent deputy governor. They don’t want that to happen.“There are insinuations that Jonah wants to join the APC and contestthe Bayelsa East senatorial election, which will be vacant if the APCwins the governorship election because the incumbent senator is therunning mate to the APC candidate, David Lyon. So, the party leaderswant Jonah out of the way but Isenah is refusing to be used to carryout the process,” he said.Meanwhile, Dickson has said that the APC does not have what it takesto win any elections under a peaceful and democratic atmosphere in thestate, no matter their antics.The governor in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, FidelisSoriwei, also maintained that the PDP would beat its major oppositionto retain political control in Bayelsa in the forthcoming polls as ithas always done.He said the PDP candidate, Diri, has had a robust history productivepublic service driven by his passion and love for Bayelsa and the Ijawnation.He said the outcome of the APC's controversial governorship primariesreflected the pitiable credentials of the party, and its level ofunpreparedness in terms of engaging the PDP in a free, fair andcredible political contest.Describing the APC governorship candidate as unsellable, the governorcalled on the media to provide a platform for all the governorshipcandidates to debate on issues bordering on their party manifestoes,the polity, and development of the state.He said: “This election is a very important election where you willeither vote for stability or instability, security or insecurity,development or retrogression. But knowing the kind of people you are,I know the party you will cast your votes for.“The candidates are all there. As a party, we are preparing tokick-start our campaigns. I know the other side (the APC) is notprepared for the election. They are preparing to kill and maim. Theyare preparing for a fight and intimidation of our people.“As usual, they are also preparing to write and announce fake results.But my party will be going out to all the nooks and crannies to talkto the people.”
