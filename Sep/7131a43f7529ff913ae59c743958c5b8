1 Week Ago Oside Oluwole, a student of the institution and Coordinator of Alliance of Nigerian Students against Neo-liberal Attacks (ANSA) FUOYE Chapter, told SaharaReporters: “It is sad. Joseph Icon will be buried today. He will be buried in Edo State. “It is a long journey but students and the executive member of the students will be attending the burial.” He added that the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) had intervened in seeking justice for the two students killed and the reinstatement of the proscribed students’ union of the institution by the management. “The NANS executive is on the ground and they are making progress in resolving the whole matter. They (NANS) have moved their headquarters to Ekiti in order to ensure everything is well resolved,” Oluwole explained.
