Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Femi Falana, has rubbished claims by the Department of State Services that it did not receive copies of a Federal High Court order directing it to immediately release pro-democracy campaigner and Publisher of Sahara Reporters, Omoyele Sowore. Responding to a statement credited to the spokesperson for the DSS, Dr Peter Afunnaya, Falana said that one Ayuba Adam of the agencyâ€™s Legal Service Department received the said court order on September 25, 2019 at exactly 10:08am. The popular lawyer wondered why the government was misleading the public rather than release Sowore, who had promptly fulfilled his bail condition in line with the court order.
