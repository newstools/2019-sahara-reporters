Process and Industrial Development Limited has accused the Nigerian Government of illegally detaining individuals associated with it in a bid to forcefully get information from them. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission had charged two representatives of the company on tax evasion and fraud. Andrew Stafford Q.C. of Kobre and Kim, who spoke on behalf of P&ID, said the detention and trial is illegal, adding that the Nigerian Government was trying to provoke the implementation of the $9.6bn damages issued against the country. Stafford said, “The Nigerian Government, through the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, is carrying out a targeted campaign of detention aimed at individuals associated with P&ID and the $9.6bn arbitration award P&ID won against Nigeria. “The detentions are illegal and appear to be aimed at coercing false testimony to support Nigeria’s claim that P&ID’s award is a fraud. “Nigeria’s Attorney-General, Abubakar Malami, has acknowledged that his aim is to provoke global opposition against P&ID by undertaking these attacks. “P&ID calls on the Nigerian Government to accept its responsibilities under the law and to cease the unlawful detentions.”
