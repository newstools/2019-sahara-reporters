This desecration must stop now,” the communiqué said.It urged the youth to rise up and graduate from being referred to asmere future leaders to leaders of today and tomorrow, adding, “hencewe cannot afford to mortgage our future by maintaining criminalsilence on this pertinent issue".The coalition called for a more inclusive and unified process, devoidof politics and political party colouration, adding “involvement oftraditional institutions in the Yoruba nation will be fully involved.“The emergence of Banji Akintoye as Yoruba leader, we believe, canjeopardize our future, if care is not taken, because it has causedmore disunity among Yoruba than any good.“While his personality is not a subject of debate, the process isshameful, unprofessional, despicable, barbaric and undermined thestatus of a professor.“We hence charge him to put the interest of Yoruba race first and hisname so as not to be shamefully recounted in history as a saboteur ofthe Yoruba nation for personal aggrandizement,” it said.The group emphasized that Afenifere remained the umbrella body of theYoruba nation.“Pa Reuben Fasoranti is its true leader," the coalition explained.“On this note, the Yoruba youth groups, under this coalition, herebyreject and denounce the nomination and election that pronounced Prof.Banji Akintoye as Yoruba leader.“We are appealing to him to wait for his time. It is God who elevatesand gives a position to humans. He should not be deceived by thoseseeking to destroy him and disunite the Yoruba race further,” thecommuniqué said.
