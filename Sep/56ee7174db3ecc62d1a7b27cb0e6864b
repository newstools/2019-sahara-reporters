Inspector-General of Police (IG-P), Mohammed Adamu Mohammed Adamu, the Inspector-General of Police, says the police will train civilians to help with policing of criminals within communities. Adamu, while speaking in Ado-Ekiti, the capital city of Ekiti State, said this was in line with the approved state-based policing. According to him, the police is ready to clamp down on kidnappers, bandits, and other criminals. He said: “Our strategy for policing has changed. The community is now working with us and we are going to ensure that all the communities are represented whether you are traditional rulers or you belong to any socio-cultural group. “We are going to train people from each community who will have the power of the police and power to arrest. They will be deployed to help the police in fighting crimes. When it comes to recruitment, we will come to your communities. “There are isolated cases of robbery, kidnapping, and cultism in the South-west of recent and we believe the traditional rulers and the state governors must show commitment and we are ready to do anything to mitigate the security problems. “We believe that if we all work together by way of robbing minds and sharing ideas. Our society will be free of crimes.” “We have bought patrol vehicles and with the state of the art technology that can checkmate crimes. “We believe no officer should die in the course of fighting crimes. To this end, body armours have been procured to protect us while confronting the evildoers. If you kill one police officer, the government has lost the money spent to train such a man.”
