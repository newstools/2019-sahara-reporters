The Nigerian Government has approved $5.3bn for the construction of the Ibadan to Kano rail line. This was disclosed by the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, on Thursday during the third Maritime Stakeholders Interactive Forum. He said, “Just yesterday, we got approval to complete the $5.3bn Ibadan to Kano rail project. “We have also applied for funding to commence coastal rail for the Port Harcourt to Warri segment.” He also disclosed that Minister of State for Transportation, Gbemisola Saraki, would be in charge of all maritime agencies. He said, “In my first term as minister, I completely abandoned the maritime sector to the heads of agencies. This time, that won’t be happening again. “I have instructed that the Minister of State for Transportation should personally supervise the maritime agencies, while I just oversee what is happening. “There are two things I discussed with the President that I will be focusing on in this second term as minister, and they are maritime security and the single window project. “I have assured the government that by the end of 2020, we should have the single window at our maritime sector.”
