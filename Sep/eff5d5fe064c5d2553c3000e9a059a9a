21 Wilberforce, a Christain organisation, says it will honour Benjamin Kwashi, an Anglican Bishop in northern Nigerian, and his wife, for enduring persecution in Nigeria. The couple will receive the Frank Wolf International Religious Freedom Award from 21Wilberforce during a September 30 event at Dallas Baptist University. The organisation said Kwashi received multiple death threats, his wife endured a savage beating by Islamist militants, and both their home and their church were burned. “Their life story is one of courage, faith and boundless love,” said Randel Everett, founder and president of 21Wilberforce. In spite of the suffering the Kwashis endured personally, the couple took in 50 orphans who lost their parents due to violence. He is the bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Jos, Nigeria, and General Secretary of GAFCON, the Global Anglican Future Conference.
