A 74-year-old woman will deliver twin babies on Thursday in India after being married for 54 years without a child. Yerramatti Raja Rao is set to be delivered of her babies in a private hospital in Guntur city, India, as doctors have made arrangements for the procedure. The birth of the twin babies will topple a record set by another Indian woman who gave birth to twin babies in 2015 at the age of 70. The oldest woman ever reported to have a baby was in Italy at the age of 101. According to doctors, Rao who hailed from Nelapartipadu in East Godavari district married Mangayamma on March 22, 1962. After a few years of their marriage, they expected children, but dreams were not fulfilled, Hans India reports. Though the couple became old, their dream was not fulfilled. Recently, a woman residing near their house became pregnant at the age of 55 through IVF. Rao drew inspiration from her. She along with her husband approached Ahalya Nursing Home in Guntur city. Since then, Rao was under the supervision of doctors in the nursing home. A caesarian would be performed on as doctors noticed twins in her womb. "If Mangayamma (Rao) will give birth to children, it will become a world record,‚Äù one of the doctors said.
