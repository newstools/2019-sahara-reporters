Otunba Gani Adams A northern youth group, Arewa Youth Movement, has condemned a commentmade by Gani Adams, leader of Oodua People's Congress against herdsmenresiding in Nigeria's south-west region.Adams, while reacting to the killing of 36 cows in Ondo by lightning,had said, "Herders should move out of the South-West immediatelybecause they don’t have anywhere to stay in the zone. The South-Westwill not be convenient for them. Warning that the sad occurrence isjust a tip of the iceberg and a caution to herdsmen and otherlivestock shepherds."Angered by the comment, National Publicity Secretary of AYM, MallamAbdulrahman Mohammed, in a statement said northern youths would notcontinue to watch Adams threaten herders “who are legitimatelytransacting their businesses in Yoruba land”.Mohammed also called on President Muhammadu Buhari and the InspectorGeneral of Police to caution Adams from making further threats againstherders in the south-west.He said: “We, therefore, call on the President of Federal Republic ofNigeria, President Mohammadu Buhari, Inspector General of Police, Mr.Adamu Mohammed to please take note of these frequent threats fromChief Gani Adams to herders/cattle breeders who are genuinelytransacting their lawful businesses in the South Western part ofNigeria.“We urge the Inspector General of Police not to take this issue withsoft hands.“This is one of the reasons why we are becoming more panicky andapprehensive by the South West security arrangements being puttogether by the South West Governors and The Inspector General ofPolice, in collaboration with the Oodua People's Congress.“This should be critically looked into as Hausa/Fulani who arelegitimate cattle rearers/breeders will be the first target of OoduaPeople's Congress and Chief Gani Adams.“His outburst has clearly shown what he will go extra miles to ask hismen to go after our people. This is a very good advantage for him tocarry out his long-time disastrous plan.”Mohammed also urged the director general of the Department of StateServices to take note of the threat by the OPC leader, pointing outthat the threat can destabilize the peaceful coexistence of Nigeriaand also heat up the polity.Mohammed added, “We call on South-West governors, traditional rulersand other stakeholders in Yoruba land to also put Chief Gani Adamsinto check. We'll not fold our hands while our people who reside inYoruba land are being killed and maimed by Chief Gani Adams and hismembers. It is very hazardous, perilous and dangerous to hand over thesecurity of lives and properties in the hands of a 'warmonger'  andtribalistic person of his type.“Therefore, the Yoruba are scattered all over the Northern parts ofNigeria, no one is threatening them. If Chief Gani Adams thinks he cansee still have an occasion which can bring him to the north, such asAbuja, Sokoto, Kano, Kaduna, Niger, Katsina, etc. He should guide hisutterances and put himself into check.“In the same vein, we appeal to our people who reside in the SouthWest and other geopolitical zones in Nigeria to be law-abidingcitizens and not to get themselves involved in any incriminating andnefarious activities that can bring about disharmony and unrest. Theyshould maintain law and order in their dealings.”
