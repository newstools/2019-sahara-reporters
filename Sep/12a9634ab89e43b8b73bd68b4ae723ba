Former federal lawmaker, Shehu Sani, has condemned charges of treason and felony levelled against pro-democracy campaigner, Omoyele Sowore, by the government. In a statement on Sunday in Abuja, Sani described the trial as unnecessary and uncalled for, adding that the action would further stain and diminish the human rights record of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government. He said, "Soworeâ€™s charges amount to electrocution of freedom. "The democratic credentials of any elected government is not simply about the legitimacy of its mandate but about the degree of its tolerance to dissent and compliance with the fundamental principles of freedom. "I appeal to the government to drop the charges filed against Sowore. "Our democracy is becoming inhabitable and inhospitable to its ideal content. "When a state equates dissent to disloyalty, it progressively decays under the weight of its courtiers." Sani added that if the government was confident of moral standing and support base, it should defeat Sowore with superior ideas.
