Nigeria's major opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party has slammed President Muhammadu Buhari for celebrating a pledge of $300,000 (N108 million) from the Japanese Prime Minister and a promissory note for €50 million from an EU commissioner. The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement on Sunday, said, “The conference has shown that no world leader or international investors want to do any real business with Nigeria under President Buhari, mainly because of the legitimacy burden of his presidency arising from the rigging of the February 23 presidential election, as well as overt impunity, corruption, treasury looting and recklessness that pervade his administration. “It is lamentable that while President Buhari and his party, the All Progressives Congress are celebrating a mere pledge of $300,000 (N108m) from the Japanese Prime Minister and a promissory note for €50 million from an EU commissioner, his Ghanaian counterpart, Nana Akufo-Ado, sealed a deal with automobile giant, Toyota, to immediately establish a Toyota and Suzuki manufacturing plant in Ghana with a determined timeline of August 2020 for production. “The multinational had also signed a deal to establish a similar plant in neighbouring Ivory Coast with a Memorandum of Understanding to that effect already signed last Thursday.”
