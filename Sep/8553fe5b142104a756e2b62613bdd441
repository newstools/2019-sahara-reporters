Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has said that a special team will soon be deployed to the South-West region of Nigeria to combat rising insecurity in the area. Adamu spoke in Akure, the Ondo State capital, on Thursday while addressing men of the state’s Police Command in Ogbatoro. He said, “We held a summit in Ibadan where all relevant stakeholders, governors, traditional rulers and other security agencies were present to brainstorm on how to secure the South-West geopolitical zone. “And having done that, I felt I need to go from one command to another to also sensitise the personnel towards implementing the resolutions of the summit. “We are now ready for the deployment of the special team in the zone to reinforce what the police are currently doing.”
