National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress and former governor of Edo State, Adams Oshiomhole, has accused his successor, Godwin Obaseki, of abandoning projects his administration started. Speaking on a programme on Channels Television, Oshiomhole said, “We have no argument over money or appointment. “During a meeting we held with four governors including Governor Bagudu, I asked the governor, how many commissioners did I nominate in your cabinet, he agreed that I only nominated one person out of more than 20 commissioners. “Not many Nigerians will believe that because for me I was out of government and I have convinced myself that the day I step out of government, that is it. “After that first meeting, the governor decided to remove that one commissioner along with seven others. But that is not my business. “The governor can never tell you that I have interfered in his choice of projects and so on. “The only thing I feel a bit worried about is that some of the projects we started together have been abandoned.”
