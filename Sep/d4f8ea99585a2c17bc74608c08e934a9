  One person has been reportedly killed by the police in Lagos as protesters stormed the Shoprite outlet on Lekki-Epe Expressway on Tuesday in response to xenophobic attacks on Nigerians in South Africa. It was also gathered that a van belonging to the Nigeria Police Force was burnt by the angry mob following the killing of the protester by the police. A video making the rounds on popular social networking platform Twitter and confirmed by some residents, showed a body on the floor as gunshots rent the air while another footage showed a police van burning. Another video currently trending revealed a man wielding a cutlass with his face covered with handkerchief.  Nollywood actress, Belinda Effah, in a post on Twitter disclosed that hoodlums had hijacked the protest and that the place had become very tensed. She said, “Jakande area is very unsafe right now; area boys everywhere. Everyone ran and left their cars. “As I was about to run out, the boys carrying machetes and stones told me it’s not me they are after, they are looking for South Africans to kill. “These same boys vandalised some cars. I saw one of them stone a car and broke the windshield. “After a while, they came to our car and asked for some money. They have blocked the Jakande Road and passengers are so afraid.” Spokesperson for the police in Lagos, Bala Elkana, refused to give specific details on the crisis when contacted.
