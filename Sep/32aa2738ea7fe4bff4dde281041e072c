 Nollywood actor, Kunle Afolayan, has cancelled his planned visit to Durban, South Africa, in response to xenophobic attacks against Nigerians in that country. He made the disclosure in a video posted on his Instagram page on Thursday. Afolayan said he had planned to visit the country with some of his colleagues on a tour but had to cancel the trip due to the latest development. He however, used the medium to apologise to his supporters for any inconveniences his decision might have caused. He said, “South Africa is not a safe place for people to go right now. “And I don’t think anybody should go to South Africa until our brothers and sisters over there come to their senses.” Afolayan follows in the footsteps of celebrities like Wizkid, Burna Boy and Tiwa Savage that had all cancelled visits to South Africa as a result of the attacks on Nigerians and other African migrants.
