We have over the timecalled for a probe of the NDDC management right from its inception.“Independent findings have revealed that the governors who influencedappointments in NDDC board in the past, apart from mismanaging statefunds also partook in sharing funds of the commission meant fordevelopment.“It is unfortunate that the governors now find it convenient tocriticize the president for appointing people of impeccable charactersthat would oversee the development of the region.“We challenge the governors to point out the part of the Actestablishing NDDC that mandates the state governors to make inputs inthe appointment of Boards in a federal system”, the statement added.The group further urged the president to disregard what it describedas ranting by the state governors saying they were confident that themembers of the new Board would deliver on their mandate.The 16 member board has Dr. Pius Odubu from Edo State as Chairman andMr. Bernard Okumagba from Delta State, as the Managing Director.The board members are Otobong Ndem from Akwa Ibom, who would serve asthe Executive Director, Projects, and Aisha Muhammed from Kano Staterepresenting North-West on the board.Others are Maxwell Okoh from Bayelsa State; Jones Erue from DeltaState; Victor Ekhatar from Edo State; Joy Nunieh from Rivers State;Nwogu Nwogu from Abia State; Theodore Allison from Bayelsa State;Victor Antai from Akwa Ibom State; Maurice Effiwatt from Cross RiverState; Olugbenga Elema from Ondo State and Uchegbu Kyrian from ImoState, News Agency of Nigeria reports.
