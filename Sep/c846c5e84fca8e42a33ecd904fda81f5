This our move isconsequent on the Supreme Court judgment on Rivers.“We can’t build the party from outside and the National WorkingCommittee decided to put a caretaker committee in place that willliaise with those that will come and conduct congresses from ward tostate.“My role is to simply inaugurate a committee to give it legal backing.The APC is divided in Rivers State and your first task is to reconcilethe divides.“We shall also send a high-level team to forge reconciliation ahead ofthe congress. We are not going to be indifferent to the situation inRivers since politics is about the people.“Our members have paid a huge price in Rivers and you all know thecost of fighting to finish. As things stand today in Rivers, we don’teven have a local government councillor. That can’t be the wish of thepeople of Rivers State and we know the actors but we don’t want to gointo details.“I hope the few setbacks we suffered is the lesson we need not to toethe path of crisis. You must put the party first. Yes, as human beingswe have feelings but what matters is our capacity to put the interestof APC members in Rivers State into account, so that the people comingto do the congresses will have a reliable local base.“You have the challenging task of managing the various shades ofopinions in Rivers. We are the net losers in Rivers but we hope youcan subordinate your interest to the larger interest of our party.“Our doors are open, we are ready to listen to advise and we shall doall we need to do to make the Congresses successful.”
