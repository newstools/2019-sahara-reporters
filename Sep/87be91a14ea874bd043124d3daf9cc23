A pro-democracy group, Kwara Must Change, has called on the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari to drop treasonable charges against Convener of #RevolutionNow movement, Omoyele Sowore. The group urged Buhari to use the points highlighted by Sowore as motivation to connect and engage Nigerians, who share similar radical political ideology like Sowore. Convener of Kwara Must Change, Abdulrazaq Hamzat, said President Buhari should be worried that under his administration, a considerable number of progressive youths in the country were leaning towards radical political ideology in their quest to get a Nigeria that works. He said, “Many young people do not even mind being imprisoned if it would get us closer to making Nigeria better. “While Sowore and other courageous comrades are transforming their anger into motivation for positive action such as protest, there are millions of others who share similar radical ideas but are likely going to use it for negative purposes. “Rather than indiscriminate arrest and incarceration, the government should take their criticism as a call to action to do more.”
