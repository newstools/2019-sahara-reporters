Forty-six volunteer officers of the Nigeria Securities and Civil Defence Corps have been arrested and detained by the police in Adamawa for staging a peaceful demonstration demanding their entitlements. The volunteer corps, numbering 631, staged the protest in Yola, the state capital, on Thursday. Livingston Mohammed, who led the protest, said over 630 people were captured as volunteers in 2008 but up to date none of them were not regularised. He said, “We have been screened by the committees but as at this moment, we are still awaiting regularisation.” However, the Adamawa State Commandant of the corps, Nurudeen Abdullahi, said there are no volunteers of the corps in the state. Spokesperson of the police in the state, Suleiman Nguroje, told SaharaReporters that the NSCDC officers were arrested because they blocked a major road in the city. He said, “They also blocked access way in and out of the Federal Secretariat, thus preventing workers from going in to do their legitimate work. “We are interrogating them and by tomorrow if they are found wanting, they will be charged to court according to the law of the land.”
