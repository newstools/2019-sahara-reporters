One of Arik's A340 jets Arik Air on Friday resumed flights to Osubi Airport, Warri, Delta State, few months after it suspended services on the route, according to the News Agency of Nigeria. Chief Executive Officer of the airline, Capt. Roy Ilegbodu, confirmed the development on Friday in Lagos. Ilegbodu said the airline would be operating flights to Warri from both Lagos and Abuja every day of the week. According to him, Arik Air suspended operations to Osubi Airport earlier in the year because of its Bombardier Q400 aircraft that went for maintenance abroad. He said, “We are pleased to announce the return of flight services to Warri. “We assure our customers of high standards of service and travel experience.”
