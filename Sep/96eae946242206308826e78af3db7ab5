  Vice President Yemi Osinbajo says ministers are expected to presenttheir first performance reports in December but did not disclose ifthe reports will be made public.He also did not state if ministers with sub-par performance would beasked to go.Osinbajo stated this in Abuja on Monday while declaring open the 2019Annual Management Conference of the Nigerian Institute of Managementthemed, 'Managing the Challenges of Democracy'.“Let me speak quickly to what will be done differently on theimplementation of government plans in this dispensation. After thepresidential policy dialogue preceding the inauguration of ministers,the president developed a list of specific mandates for each ministry."Each of those mandates has clearly spelt out action points," the vicepresident explained.He, therefore, added, “Every minister has a mandate with actionpoints, some of the mandates have seven or eight points. The ministersare to render their first reports on performance in December."So, in some sense, we are moving to a more measurable way ofdetermining where ministers are going and what they ought to do. Ofcourse, there would be challenges of funding, clarity of plans etc."
