The Police Service Commission (PSC) has warned applicants of its ongoing recruitment of 10,000 police constables to disregard a list of candidates circulating on social media. The spokesman for PSC, Ikechukwu Ani, stated this in a statement Wednesday. According to him, the list which originated from the Nigeria Police Force's website contained some names of candidates who applied for recruitment into the police for the position of constables.He said the candidates, according to the information, were invited for medical screening scheduled for 9 to 14 of September 2019.Ani said, “It has been observed that as of the afternoon of today, Wednesday, September 4, 2019, the list has been withdrawn from their website. “The commission will like to report that the list was compiled solely by the Nigeria Police Force without the involvement of the Police Service Commission, the body that has the constitutional mandate for the appointment. "All candidates who took part in the aptitude test held on Saturday, August 3, 2019, are hereby to watch out for the authentic list that will emerge after the meeting of the bodies." He added, “The leadership of the commission since coming into office has been doing everything possible to restore sanity not only in the recruitment exercise but also in all other facets of the mandate of the Commission.” Ani noted further that the commission would continue to insist that the recruitment exercise is merit-driven, transparent and in conformity with the Public Service Rules and Federal Character principle. “(The commission) will resist any attempt to sabotage its efforts in this direction. Applicants are, therefore, advised not to panic or despair as all their interests will be adequately protected.”
