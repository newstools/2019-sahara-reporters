Human rights activists have called for a probe into the death of two students of the Federal University Oye-Ekiti, Ekiti State, allegedly caused by policemen on the entourage of wife of Ekiti State Governor, Bisi Fayemi. In a statement jointly issued by the Convener, Coalition in Defence of Democracy and Constitution, Dare Atoye, and Executive Director, Policy Advocacy and Integrity Network, Joe Mesele, in Abuja on Sunday, the group called on appropriate authorities to immediately set up an open and impartial judicial panel of inquiry to investigate the killings and ensure that the real culprits were brought to book. The statement reads, “We are deeply puzzled and pained to see the police in Ekiti State attempting to twist and reduce the sad and avoidable incident in Oye-Ekiti in which two students were cut-down in their prime, to a single story narrative and blame the entire saga on the students.
