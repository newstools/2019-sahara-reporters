Despite claims by the President Muhammadu Buhari regime's claim thatthe terrorist group Boko Haram no longer holds any major territoriesin the North-East, at least the insurgents are occupying eight out of10 local government areas in the northern part of Borno State.That is what a federal lawmaker, Ahmadu Jaha (of the All ProgressivesCongress representing Damboa-Gwoza-Chibok), said on Tuesday during aplenary session of the house of representatives while contributing toa motion on the need for special funding for security agencies.“A number of geographical locations in Borno State and otherinsurgency-related areas are under the occupation of Boko Haram,” hesaid.“Let us take for instance, in a local government that has 13 electoralwards like my own Gwoza, only three or four are not under theoccupation of Boko Haram.“In Chibok, I have 10 electoral wards, only two are not under theoccupation of Boko Haram. In Damboa, I have 10 electoral wards, onlyone is not under the occupation of Boko Haram. This is as far asChibok/Damboa/Gwoza federal constituency is concerned.“The chief whip to the house can bear me witness, out of the 10 localgovernments in northern Borno, only two local governments and it isonly their headquarters, are still not under the occupation of BokoHaram.”
