Former Vice President and presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, has reacted to the decision of the Presidential Election Tribunal, which validated the victory of President Muhammadu Buhari during the February 2019 election. In a lengthy personal note on his Twitter handle, Atiku said Nigerians must stand together against blackmail of the judiciary. He said, “I write to personally thank you for your support for our shared common goal and the solidarity I enjoyed right from July 21, 2018, when I informed you, the good people of Nigeria, that I would contest the 2019 presidential election, to Wednesday September 11, 2019, when the PEPT rendered its verdict. “Nothing good comes easy, and hard as the task to rid Nigeria from the forces of fascism and be an instrument for the full restoration of the rule of law and democracy in Nigeria is, your support makes the struggle worthwhile. “And only by ensuring that democracy is not just done, but seen to be done, can Nigeria and Nigerians have a sense that this our dear land is indeed a land where unity, faith, peace and progress reside. “Those who do not want this as Nigeria’s reality, will use every trick in the book to undermine, discourage, misinform and mislead but with God’s help and the support of Nigerians, we will ensure that Nigeria makes a course correction away from tyranny and towards democracy. “We must return to being Africa’s bastion of democracy where the rights to freedom of speech and freedom after the speech are guaranteed. “I say to all concerned that we will all die and give account of our lives to our creator.”
