Kurdish authorities in northeast Syria have handed over three siblings linked with the Islamic State group to the Nigerian Government, AFP reports. Fanar Kaeet, a Kurdish foreign affairs official, said, “Three children were handed over to representatives of the Nigerian Government.” The siblings are a girl and two boys – all between five and 10 years old – who had lost both parents, Kaeet said. A representative of the Nigeria Government, Musa Marika, said efforts were ongoing to look into the matter. He said, “We have asked the foreign relations department at the Kurdish administration for a list of Nigerians and Africans under their custody. “As for Nigerian (IS) fighters, the government will look into this.”
