Samson Ayolunle, in a statement by his media aide,Bayo Oladeji, said, “Anyone accused of corruption has to prove his orher innocence with documentary evidence before the court of competentjurisdiction as we all know before his or her innocence can be upheld.“After we had interacted with him and he said that the allegation wasbaseless and should be treated as rubbish, and not only that, he saidthat he was going to pursue the matter legally to prove his innocence.We then assured him that if he is proved innocent, then we throw ourweight behind him.“We thereafter prayed for him and our nation Nigeria. We urged him tocontinue to serve the nation with clean hands.“The leadership of CAN has never endorsed corruption. In our earliervisits to President Muhammadu Buhari, we had praised him for fightinga war against corruption, but urged him to make it comprehensive,sparing no one irrespective of political affiliation.”
