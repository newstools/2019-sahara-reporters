  South African Catholic Archbishop, Buti Tigagale, has condemned theSouth African government for doing too little to protect victims ofxenophobic attacks in the country.He said this in a statement released in Abuja on Saturday.He said: “Once again we receive reports of the authorities doing verylittle to protect the victims. We received report of police standingby idly in Pretoria while shops were looted and people attacked. Not asingle arrest was made on that day.“Once again the authorities resort to the old explanation: that thisis not xenophobia, but the work of criminal elements.“Let us be absolutely clear – this is not an attempt by concernedSouth Africans to rid our cities of drug dealers. And this is not thework of a few criminal elements. It is xenophobia, plain and simple.“If it was about drugs, why are South African drug dealers not beingtargeted as well? Are we really to believe that there are none? Andwhy are drug addicts who rob people in our city centres to get moneyto buy drugs not being targeted? If it is the work of a few criminalelements, why are South African owned businesses not being looted aswell?“The teaching of the Church is direct and uncompromising. More than80% of South Africans claim to be Christian. What are our religiousleaders teaching the multitudes that fill our churches every Sunday?Galatians 3:28 says: 'There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slavenor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in ChristJesus'.”By the same token, there is neither South African nor Nigerian norEthiopian. We are all one in Christ Jesus.“Let us take heed of this. We are facing a rising tide of hatred andintolerance, no different to the rising tide of hatred in NaziGermany. If we do not take urgent action to stop it, there will benothing left.”
