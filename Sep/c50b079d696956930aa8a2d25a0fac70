When Islamic State gunmen stormed the northeast Nigerian town ofMagumeri on the night of August 21, they had free rein.Nigerian soldiers had left the town earlier that month under a newstrategy of withdrawing to "super camps" that can be more easilydefended against insurgents the army has been struggling to containfor a decade.Unchallenged, the Islamist militants torched a clinic in Magumeri,ransacked government buildings and looted shops before returning toanother town they had raided that night called Gubio, residents said.The new military strategy announced by President Muhammadu Buhari inJuly to concentrate soldiers in big bases is designed to give troops asecure platform from which they can respond quickly to threats in theregion and raid militant camps.People familiar with the military's thinking and security officials,however, say the new tactic for fighting Islamic State's West Africabranch and Boko Haram is mainly an attempt to stem casualties.The military did not respond to requests for more details about itsstrategy or the impact it will have on the region."We strongly believe the days of BH (Boko Haram) moving freely andpassing in between static defensive locations are over," Major GeneralOlusegun Adeniyi, who commands the anti-insurgency operation, toldreporters last month.Boko Haram launched an insurgency in 2009 to overthrow the governmentand establish an Islamic caliphate. The group, whose unofficial namemeans "Western education is forbidden", held territory the size ofBelgium in 2014 but a multinational offensive recaptured much of itthe following year.The group split in 2016 and the faction that has been the greaterthreat ever since won the recognition of Islamic State.The decade of war has killed more than 30,000 civilians and spawnedwhat the United Nations calls one of the world's worst humanitariancrises, which foreign nations are trying to contain with billions ofdollars of aid.But the crisis shows no sign of abating.'IT'S A MESS'The army's withdrawal into large bases has coincided with a string ofinsurgent raids on newly unprotected towns and has left the militantsfree to set up checkpoints on roads as they roam more freely acrossthe countryside, according to three briefing notes from aninternational aid and development organisation, two security officialsand residents.That has left thousands of civilians without access to aid, accordingto the briefing notes seen by Reuters.Soldiers are no longer protecting some key roads, cutting off accessfor humanitarians workers as more of the region falls under the swayof the insurgents, aid and security sources said."It's a mess, militarily, and a disaster for humanitarian actors," oneforeign security official said.The population of towns being abandoned by the military is a combined223,000 people, according to one of the aid agency briefing notes.The military departures so far have cut off more than 100,000 peoplefrom aid and if more soldiers go, as many as 121,000 other civilianscould flee their towns, one aid agency briefing note said."The impact will be one of the continued skirmishes - soldiers underconstant strain to deal with the insurgency where Islamic State andBoko Haram dictate the momentum," said Jasmine Opperman, a terrorismexpert based in South Africa.It's not yet clear how many "super camps" the army plans to set up,where they will be nor how many soldiers each will hold.'HERE TO PROTECT YOU'The new strategy follows a series of setbacks for the army which hasfailed to keep a tight grip on territory it has clawed back since2015. Last year, insurgents repeatedly overran smaller bases and sentsoldiers and tens of thousands of people fleeing from larger towns.Security experts put the military death toll since June 2018 atanywhere from hundreds of soldiers to in excess of 1,000.The military has not released casualty figures but denies that manysoldiers have been killed.One security adviser at an international aid organisation said a majorgoal of the new large bases was damage control, rather than going onthe offensive."It is to consolidate all of the strength in one place to prevent themfrom being overrun every week," the adviser said.He said the areas vacated were being filled by insurgents and thatwould make it harder for the military to re-enter, leaving civiliansvulnerable.Those concerns were echoed by the governor of Borno - the birthplaceof Boko Haram and the state worst hit by the insurgency. GovernorBabagana Umara Zulum told reporters last month that recent attackswere the result of a "serious vacuum" following the withdrawal ofsoldiers.Islamic State is also using its newfound freedom to woo locals.Drained by the decade-long conflict, some are open to moving intoareas controlled by the insurgents where life can be more stable,residents said.Before hitting Magumeri last month, the militants had passed throughthe town of Gubio, some 40 km (25 miles) to the north.There, an Islamic State fighter led evening prayers followed by asermon, according to six residents."We are here to protect you, not to harm anyone of you," the ISfighter told residents. "Those with uniforms are your enemies, and weare here to deal with them and their supporters. You should feelfree."Rather than flee to a government-controlled city such as Borno state'scapital Maiduguri, many Gubio residents stayed, Reuters reports.
