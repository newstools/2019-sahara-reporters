Vice President of Nigeria, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, has described as unacceptable ongoing attacks on Nigerians in South Africa. In a statement through his spokesperson, Laolu Akande, Osinbajo comdemned the development, adding that it does not represent the ideals of iconic leaders like Nelson Mandela. He said, “It is very sad and very unfortunate that the lives and livelihoods of Nigerians living in South Africa are once again being destroyed with such wantonness and with such carelessness and recklessness. “It is unfortunate because Nigeria and Nigerians invested a great deal in the pulling down of apartheid. “Besides, these acts of bigotry are entirely contrary to the very ideals that all the great South African leaders, including the present president fought for, and for which many gave their lives. “President Muhammadu Buhari has already spoken about this; and obviously we are very concerned and certainly intend to take this up with the authorities in South Africa in order to ensure that this sort of thing does not repeat itself."
