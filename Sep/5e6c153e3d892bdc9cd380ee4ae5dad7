The Katsina State government has hinted of plans to negotiate therelease of 20 of its indigenes, who were kidnapped and sold to BurkinaFaso as slaves, following their abduction by bandits.The victims, The Guardian reports, were sold to a human trafficker inthe Benin Republic, who then resold them to another buyer in BurkinaFaso.Burkina Faso is reported to be a “country of origin, transit, anddestination for persons, mostly children, subjected to humantrafficking, specifically forced labour and prostitution”.A source familiar with the issue explained that the victims were“kidnapped in Kankara Council Area and sold to a woman in Cotonou, whoin turn sold them to another slave merchant in Burkina Faso".The newspaper noted that the location of the victims was discoveredfollowing an interface Governor Aminu Bello Masari had with somerepentant bandits in eight council areas of the state.The council areas are, Jibia, Faskari, Danmusa, Kankara, Safana,Sabuwa, Dandume, and Batsari, and they share a border with Ruguforest, a dreaded hideout for bandits.Like several others in the north-west geopolitical zone, Katsina isfaced with security challenges occasioned by activities of bandits,kidnappers and cattle rustlers.The challenge has led to significant loss of lives and property, withseveral kidnap-for-ransom cases, which often ended up with some of thevictims never returning home due to relations’ inability to payransoms.But the state government’s interface with some of the repentantbandits had seen a significant reduction in cases of banditry,rustling, and kidnapping in the affected council areas.Special Adviser to the governor on Drugs, Narcotics and HumanTrafficking, Hamza Borodo, confirmed the incident but declined to givedetails, adding that he would soon travel to Burkina Faso to negotiatethe release of the 20 victims.“Yes, I will be traveling to Burkina Faso this weekend to negotiatetheir release, but I won’t give you details until I return,” he said.
