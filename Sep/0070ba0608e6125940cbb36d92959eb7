The Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), has beratedwhat it called "unprofessional and corrupt" clean-up exercise of Ogoniland by the federal government.MOSOP said the fundamental issues as recommended by the United NationsEnvironment Programme (UNEP) before the commencement of the exercisewere not followed.While accusing the governing council of Hydro-Carbon PollutionRestoration Project (HYPREP), the firm handling the clean-up ofcorruption and fraudulent practices, the group noted that theconstruction of a centre of excellence and integrated contaminatedsoil management centre, provision of potable water in communities,establishment of health registry and provision of alternativelivelihood as parts of the recommendations were jettisoned.While faulting the remediation method employed by the HydrocarbonPollution Remediation Programme as recommended by the UNEP report,MOSOP called for the immediate dissolution of the agency’s governingcouncil and demanded a probe into HYPREP’s activities.Speaking with SaharaReporters on the clean-up of Ogoni, the Presidentof MOSOP, Fegalo Nsuke, said, "The federal government's clean-up ofOgoni land fell short of the recommendations made by UNEP that thereshould be an alternative source of potable drinking water amongothers."But all the recommendations were not followed and as I talk to youtoday, in Gokana land, the firm was not allowed into the area to carryout the exercise because of failure to adhere strictly to therecommendations. As a people, we have lost total confidence in what ishappening concerning the clean-up of the land following the corruptand sharp practices by the firm."He said further, "Instead of these contracting firms to use the moniesthey have been paid for the purpose of which it was meant, the monieswere diverted and used to prosecute the 2019 general elections. So asfar as we are concerned, the Ogoni clean-up exercise has complicatedthe problems of our people rather than solving them."We can't say what they are doing. Truly speaking, we do not havecredible confidence in the whole process and we have called for thedissolution of the programme. There's a serious compromise in all theactivities and the composition of the governing council and we havecalled for a new council. Nothing is going on now. Everything isshrouded in secrecy and we don't know what is going on right now."Nsuke added that HYPREP had failed to fulfil its mandate.“It is no longer news that HYPREP, is the agency established as itwere specifically for Ogoni clean-up pursuant to the UNEPrecommendations, part of which was to carry out emergency measureslike the construction of a centre of excellence and integratedcontaminated soil management centre, provision of potable water incommunities, establishment of health registry and provision ofalternative livelihood for those involved in artisan refining and wetalk nothing, I repeat, has been done," the MOSOP leader claimed.
