The Centre for Anti-Corruption and Open Leadership has commended the decision of the government to withdraw Nigeria’s High Commissioner to South Africa, Kabiru Bala, in response to the recent xenophobic attacks on Nigerians and other African migrants in that country. CACOL also hailed the Nigerian Government’s decision to withdraw its participation from the ongoing World Economic Forum in South Africa. In a statement by CACOL’s Coordinator for Research and Documentation, Okechukwu Ndiribe, on behalf of the group’s Executive Chairman, Debo Adeniran, is said, “The Nigerian Government’s response which in diplomatic circles is considered as a government’s strongest expression of displeasure, is in order considering the scale and magnitude of the indiscriminate attacks which were launched against Nigerians and other Africans by vandals roaming the streets of Johannesburg last Sunday. “This umpteenth attack on Nigerians resident in South Africa deserves a very strong response which should convey how aggrieved Nigerians are over the ugly incident in that country. “We also expect that President Muhammadu Buhari’s next line of action should be to send South Africa’s High Commissioner in Nigeria back home. “This step, if taken, will in no unmistakable terms convey a serious message to President Cyril Ramaphosa. “President Buhari needs to take this step to serve as a deterrent against any recurrence of this unacceptable event in the future.”
