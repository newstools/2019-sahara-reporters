  Bill Gates, the co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(BMGF), says Nigeria is important and he is hopeful about the countrybut urged the government to make good use of the nation's wealth whichwill encourage Nigerians to pay taxes.Gates said Nigeria must gain more confidence from its citizens if itsinternally generated revenue would increase.The billionaire said this during a teleconference with selectedjournalists, where the goalkeepers report was unveiled.He said: “One challenge that Nigeria has is that the amount of moneythat the government raises domestically is quite small compared toother countries.”“A lot of countries at that level will be raising closer to 15 percentof GDP and Nigeria is one of the lowest in the world down at about sixpercent. And so, it is a huge challenge that when you want to fundinfrastructure, health, education, all those things, that over timethe tax collection, the domestic resources are going to have to go upquite a bit.“That’s a long-term effort and I think partly by making sure thecurrent resources are spent well like on primary health care, you gainthe credibility that the citizens will say, okay, we want more ofthese things.“If we don’t raise the quality, you can get into a trap where theydon’t feel like paying the taxes actually has that much impact, and sothey’re not supportive of that.”The report gave data on educational disparity across different communities.“Nigeria is a super-important country and one that the foundation hasan office there.  We did a lot of work in Nigeria on polio and welearned a lot doing that. Nigeria has gone almost three years nowwithout having a polio case,” Gates added.“The biggest priority we have, although making absolutely sure we’redone with polio remains a big priority, now we’re able to focus evenmore on the primary health care system.“Nigeria is important, I’m hopeful about Nigeria.  As you see in thereport, the disparities within Nigeria are quite stark.“So, we’re working hard. I mentioned we do videoconferences with stategovernors.  If we can make the six states into exemplars, then thesepractices can be extended to all 18 of the northern states.“There are best practices down in the south as well that we can learnfrom that as well. And so, you know, building on what we were able toachieve with polio and the relationships we’ve built there and ourcommitment, starting with primary health care, we think that Nigeriacan tackle its inequality."He said the wish of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, would bequality funding if the primary health care.“If I had one wish for Nigeria, it would be that the quality andfunding of the primary health care system would achieve the level ofsome other countries that are lower-income but have done a better jobwith the primary health care system.  So, it definitely is doable.“In Nigeria for a lot of the work we do there we’ve partnered AlikoDangote, who helps us understand who the good partners are and exactlyhow we can reach out to groups like the traditional leaders and getthem involved in these efforts as well.“I do a regular phone call with six of the governors in the north ofNigeria to talk about the statistics on their primary health caresystem, getting the workers there, getting the vaccine supply right,getting the mothers to show up, so that we get antenatal care to bebetter, we get vaccination rates to be better.“And it’s really the digital tools that let us, you know, every timewe meet and talk, we have a sense of, okay, what’s gone well in thelast six months, what hasn’t, and what do we need to change.”
