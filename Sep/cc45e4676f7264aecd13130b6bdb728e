  The Catholic Laity Council of Nigeria (CLCN) has called for therestructuring of Nigeria to deal with insecurity in the country.The council said it was the option if the present structure of thenation had proved too difficult for agencies to handle.The National President of CLCN, Thomas Adekoya, while addressing thecouncil at its 142 National Executive meeting in Kaduna, saidinsecurity had bastardized the image of Nigeria before local andinternational communities.Adekoya called on the government to “as a matter of urgency, initiatemoves for the restructuring of the country and saddle the federatingunits, which we suggest should be the six geopolitical zones, tosecure themselves".The Laity President said, “It is saddening that our country, Nigeria,has continued to be in the eyes of local and international communitiesfor the wrong reasons. For the past three months, or since we gave thelast state of the nation address, no single day has passed withoutnews of one gruesome killing or the other; one case of kidnapping orthe other, raping of minors by matured men, including those whodescend as low as raping their own innocent daughters.“From the foregoing it is clear that insecurity has continued todominate our national discourse. However, our greatest worry is whythe Catholic Church should be at the receiving end of some of the mostbizarre of these killings.“If we hold dear that the protection of lives and property; and thewelfare of citizens is the greatest responsibility of any governmenttowards its citizens then our present-day government has fallen farshort of the expectation of Nigerians, no matter any otherachievements it may credit itself with. One dare asks at this point:For how long shall Nigerians continue in this Hobbesian state ofnature?” Adekoya noted.The Catholic Bishop of Kaduna Archdiocese, Most Reverend MathewMan’oso Ndagoso, also called on President Muhammadu Buhari to do morein the area of providing security for the citizenry.Bishop Ndagoso who fielded questions from journalists shortly beforethe commencement of the meeting advised that since the generalelection was over, President Buhari must ensure proper nationalintegration of the country.The clergyman noted that Nigerians had been so divided following theelection of President Buhari during the last election.He said, “Anybody who cares for this country must be concerned aboutwhat is happening today regarding the insecurity.“What is happening in the North-East which has crept into theNorth-West, South-East and South-West is becoming alarming,” he noted.
