The National Youths Council of Nigeria has condemned Idris Okuneye popularly known as Bobrisky for promoting immoral acts in the society. The group expressed their view during a protest in Abuja on Wednesday organised in conjunction with the National Council for Arts and Culture, joining the likes of Women Society, and the Christian Association of Nigeria that had openly condemned Bobrisky and all that he represents. Speaking during the protest, Vice President, North-Central of NYCN, Comrade Mukhtar, described homosexuality as ungodly and unhealthy for Nigeria’s young people. He said, “The NYCN regards Bobrisky as a unguided element. We believe he is a man and not a woman. “For national interest, we call on Nigerian youths and comrades of like minds to without fear or favour kick out Bobrisky and his likes wherever they come across them. “Nigeria is not a place for LGBT and we shall fight this to the end.” The youth group called on police authorities and other security agencies to stop the activities of Bobrisky and others in the society. Saluting the courage of the protesting youths, NCAC Director-General, Otunba Segun Runsewe, said Nigeria’s respected cultural values must not be eroded by unguided elements like Bobrisky, adding that the agency will continue to work with other stakeholders to preserve Nigeria’s rich culture. Recall that the police in Lagos on August 31 shut a venue where a lavish birthday party was to be held for Bobrisky. Bobrisky, who clocked 28 on that day, had slated the celebration for two locations in Lagos but following wide criticism by members of the public, the police moved in to arrest the situation. Ever since that period, he has come under constant scrutiny by prominent individuals and groups in the country, who believe he is a bad influence on young Nigerians.
