The aircraft, a Boeing 747-300 with registration number 5N-DBK, was said to have developed a fault mid-air before the pilot struggled to land it at the airport. The incident led to the collapse of one of the four engines of the aircraft. It was further gathered that the aircraft was returning pilgrims from Niger State from Saudi Arabia.

However, a source close to the scene told our correspondent that no life was lost, while efforts to get the officials of Max Air to comment on the issue was unsuccessful.
