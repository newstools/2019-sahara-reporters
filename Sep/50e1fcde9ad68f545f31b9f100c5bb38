Family members of Robert Mugabe, a former president of Zimbabwe who died last Friday, say they do not know where their dead kinsman will be buried. Leo Mugabe, Mugabe's nephew, who is the spokesperson for the family confirmed this to Zimlive, a Zimbabwean media outfit. He also stated that the scheduled burial of the former president had also been postponed. According to Leo, Mugabe was a chief hence he would be buried according to traditional rites. “Mugabe was a chief and he will be buried in accordance with tradition. The chiefs have not told us where he will be buried, so it is not clear yet. I also don’t know,” he said.
