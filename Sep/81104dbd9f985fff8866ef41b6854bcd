The National Assembly Election Petitions Tribunal in Bayelsa State has dismissed another petition filed by the Peoples Democratic Party against the victory of the All Progressives Congress in the 2019 National Assembly election in Nembe/Brass Federal Constituency. The Independent National Electoral Commission had declared Israel Sunny-Goli of the APC as winner of the constituency during the election earlier in the year. Sunny-Goli had polled 41,150 votes against his closet rival, Mrs Marie Ebikake of the Peoples Democratic Party, who polled 19, 279. Ebikake, however, in a petition prayed the tribunal to annul the election of Sunny-Goli, citing non- compliance with the provisions of the Electoral Act and violence in seven wards of Nembe Bassambiri. The tribunal dismissed the petition for lack of documentary evidence and affirmed the victory of Sunny-Goli. Sunny-Goli while speaking with journalists, described the tribunal ruling as victory for democracy and for the people of Nembe/Brass Federal Constituency. The lawmaker urged Ebikake to join hands with him to attract development to the area, reiterating his determination to give the people of Nembe/Brass Federal Constituency quality representation at the National Assembly. He said, “The tribunal again affirmed my victory at the polls. It is a victory for the people of my constituency. “I commend the people of Nembe/Brass Federal Constituency for their unflinching support throughout the case. Now it is the time to work.”
