The Peoples Democratic Party and its presidential candidate in the February 23 election, Atiku Abubakar, and his running mate, Peter Obi, have filed an appeal at the Supreme Court over the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal judgement of September 11. The appeal was filed on Monday in Abuja. Recall that the tribunal in its ruling on September 11, had upheld President Muhammadu Buhari's re-election. The tribunal held that Abubakar and the PDP failed to discharge the burden of proof of the allegation of non-qualification of President Buhari to contest the election.
