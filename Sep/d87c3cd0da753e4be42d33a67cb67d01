The anti-corruption agency accused Taiga of receiving $20,000 bribe among other charges. The former director was arraigned before an FCT high court, Abuja. Taiga, during her trial on Friday, was escorted into the courtroom limping. The case was initially filed against her and Muhammad Kuchazi, the commercial director of P&ID British Virgin Island.
