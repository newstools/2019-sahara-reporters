Justice Taiwo Taiwo had on Wednesday ordered the Department of State Services to release Sowore on bail on the condition that he deposits his international passport to the court within 48 hours. On Thursday, Sowore's lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN), deposited the passport with the court after completing all necessary documentation. The DSS is now being awaited to comply with the ruling following the satisfaction of the bail condition set.
