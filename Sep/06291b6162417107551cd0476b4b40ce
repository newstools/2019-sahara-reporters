Xenophobic attacks in South Africa The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project has demanded the immediate compensation of victims of latest xenophobic attacks in South Africa. In an open letter signed by its Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, to Chairperson of the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights, Mrs Soyata Maiga, SERAP also called for the punishment of South Africa for not doing enough to protect foreigners especially Nigerians and other African migrants in their country. The group said, “These attacks constitute serious violations of the human rights of Nigerians and other African citizens in South Africa. “We seek punitive damages and adequate compensation of $10bn on behalf of hundreds of Nigerian victims and their families. This amount will sufficiently take into account individual harm suffered by victims. “This is a key moment for the commission to push to protect the human rights of the victims. “The commission ought to make it clear to the South African authorities that the victims of the heinous crimes have a right to an effective remedy and reparation, which includes restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition. “For the sake of the victims, the commission should move swiftly on the matter to prevent further harm to Nigerians and other foreign nationals in the country. “Unlike for individuals and NGOs, the African Court protocol does not require Nigeria to have made the declaration under Article 34(6) for the commission to submit a case on behalf of the Nigerian victims before the Court. “If the victims see that a process for ensuring adequate compensation for the crimes committed against them in South Africa is underway, it will also discourage revenge violence and killings and help break the cycle of violence that is now spiralling beyond control in the country.”
