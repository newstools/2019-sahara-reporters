This is contrary to warnings by doctors that Jalingo needs to be fully admitted to a hospital for general medical observation and treatment. Jalingo, who is the Publisher of Cross River Watch, has been in police detention after publishing an article revealing how Governor Ben Ayade approved and diverted N500m meant for Cross River Microfinance Bank. Jalingo was arrested in Lagos and transported to Calabar, capital of Cross River, where he is being detained.
