Former Senate President Bukola Saraki's educational materials sent toschools in Kwara State have been rejected by the government.It was alleged that the books had pictures and other insignias of theSaraki, a former governor of Kwara.Yakub Aliagan, the press secretary at the Kwara State Ministry ofEducation and Human Capital Development, said it was wrong forstudents' materials to carry the image or insignia of any personality.He said in a statement: “The appropriate thing to do is to send thosematerials to the Ministry of Education, which has a statutory duty ofvetting learning materials for quality control and then approve suchfor distribution. Not doing so was a violation of a basic rule, whichis key to strengthening our institutions and keeping standards.“Besides, it is wrong for anyone to emblazon their images or personallogos on instructional materials made with public resources fordistribution in public schools. The said materials were some sort ofconstituency projects, which had been approved and funded by thefederal government of Nigeria.“It is instructive to note that the Kwara State Ministry of Educationrecently approached Governor AbdulRahmanAbdulRazaq to mass-produceinstructional materials with his picture emblazoned on them ahead ofschool resumption and the governor rejected the proposal on the groundthat there should be no personalization of projects executed withpublic funds,”
