Senator Peter Nwaoboshi The Delta State National Assembly Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Asaba, the state capital, on Saturday upheld the election of Peter Nwaoboshi, lawmaker representing Delta North Senatorial district. Doris Uboh, candidate of the All Progressives Congress during the February 23, 2019 National Assembly election in the district, had challenged the election of Nwaoboshi on the ground that the poll was characterised by irregularities. Delivering the judgement after hearing the argument of both parties, the tribunal headed by Justice E. I. Ngene, dismissed the petition brought by Uboh against Nwaoboshi, saying it lacked merit.
