Co-founder of BudgIT, Seun Onigbinde, has announced his resignation as Technical Adviser to the Minister of State for Budget and National Planning. The popular critic made the announcement on Monday and shared the link of the post on his official Twitter handle @seunonigbinde. This is coming days after his appointment by Buhari’s administration was condemned by many Nigerians, who felt he had betrayed public trust by accepting to serve in a government he had heavily criticised in the past. He said, “Upon further reflections on the furore that has been generated by my new role as the Technical Adviser to the Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, I humbly resign the appointment. “I am very grateful to the Honourable Minister, Prince Clem Ikanade Agba, for believing in my expertise and I also thank everyone who sent his or her congratulations to me in the short period. “I have also been humbled by the faith and belief that numerous persons have expressed in me. “My sincere interest is to see a Nigeria that grows and optimises resources for the benefit of all Nigerians. “My loyalty to the good cause of our nation, Nigeria, compelled me to accept the call to provide technical skills and this experience has more than strengthened it. “I also want to wish the Nigerian Government, led by President Muhammadu Buhari, well. “I will always be of help to the government in my capacity as the Director of BudgIT, a critical fiscal transparency group, as I have been to several agencies. “I would also work to ensure that BudgIT continues to build civic awareness on the right of every Nigerian to know how public resources are managed.”
