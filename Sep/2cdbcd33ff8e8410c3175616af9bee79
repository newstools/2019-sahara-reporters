The African Action Congress has called on members and supporters to storm the Federal High Court in Abuja to show solidarity for its National Chairman, Omoyele Sowore. Sowore is set to appear in court on Tuesday after the Nigerian Government slammed a seven-count charge on him. In a message to all AAC members, the National Organising Secretary, Comrade Oshioks, stated that the move will send a strong message to the government for infringing on Sowore’s right. He said, “We are all expected to be at the Federal High Court, Maitama, Abuja, on days our national leader, Sowore, will be brought for his court hearing. “The solidarity from us will send the right message to those who have trampled on his fundamental human rights for the past 52 days and counting. “It will let the Nigerian Government know that the people know Sowore as a man different from the allegations cooked up against him. “Comrades, we are all encouraged to kindly attend these proceedings in solidarity. We should be in court as early as 8:00am daily.”
