Minority Caucus Leader of the House of Representatives has decried the alleged raid on  Abuja residence of Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi, the  Chairman, South-East Governors Forum. In a statement by the Minority Leader of the house, Ndudi Elumelu, the caucus said the raid was menacing and inexcusable development. According to the caucus, law enforcement agencies were free to do their job with respect to the rule of law. The caucus said it was, however, worried that police authorities had denied the foreknowledge of the operation and called for a thorough investigation. “We received with angst and rude shock the report of an illegal raid on Abuja residence of the governor of Ebonyi and Chairman of  South-East Governors Forum, Chief Dave Umahi. “The fact that the police high commands, including the office of the Inspector-General of Police, have distanced themselves from the operation makes it a suspicious operation."
