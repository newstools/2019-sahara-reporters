Nigeria Cameroon border The Nigerian Government has said that its borders would remain closed until affected countries begin to respect Nigeria's policy on food importation. Comptroller-General of Customs, Hammed Ali, disclosed this on Wednesday during a visit to Maigatari border in Jigawa State. Maigatari border town connects Nigeria and Niger Republic. He said, “Most of the criminals are not citizens of Nigeria. They come in at will and go out at will because our borders are so porous. They come and create havoc and disappear. “This is why the President directed that we should go on and embark on this drill to ensure that we put into place a proper procedure for in and outflow of people. “We must also get our neighbours to agree with us on the protocols of transit routes.” According to Ali, Nigeria has enough food and willing to ensure its borders are no longer porous.
