Aisha Buhari, the wife of President Muhammadu Buhari, has been out ofNigeria for about two months now, raising concerns at the PresidentialVilla, Daily Trust reports.According to the newspaper, multiple sources at the presidential villasaid the president’s wife left the country in protest against “certaindevelopments” at the presidency.It reported that the first lady, who left the country early August toSaudi Arabia to perform hajj (Muslim pilgrimage), had not returned tothe country.Muslims who participated in the hajj exercise have since returnedhome, but credible sources at the Villa said the president’s wife hassince left Saudi Arabia for London.“Mama (first lady) is in London. It was from Saudi Arabia that shewent to London,” a  source told Daily Trust.Asked when she would return, the source said, “I don’t know. All Iknow is that she is in London.”Her absence became obvious after she did not appear alongside herhusband at recent official functions.She was absent during the Eid-El-Kabir celebration in Daura, KatsinaState in which President Buhari hosted many dignitaries includingGuinean president, Alpha Conde, during the Sallah celebrations.In early July, the first lady supported her husband to host theAmbassador Extraordinary for Nigeria-Niger Cooperation, together withhis wife, Fatima at the State House.Recently, at public events, Dr. Hajo Sani, the Senior SpecialAssistant to Buhari on administration,  has been representing thepresident’s wife.For instance, on September 25, she was represented at an event of theOrganization of African First Ladies for Development (OAFLAD), on thesidelines of the 74th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), New Yorkby Dr. Hajo.According to a statement from the director of information to AishaBuhari, the event was attended by first ladies of Zimbabwe, SierraLeone, Uganda, and the Niger Republic.President Buhari was one of the world leaders that attended the 74th UNGA.However, checks on Mrs. Buhari's Twitter handle, @aishabuhari, showedthat she remained active on the social media platform, as only sixdays ago she retweeted a post on the war against corruption.Efforts to get the reaction of her media aide, Suleiman Haruna, wasunsuccessful.In June, Mrs. Buhari announced the change of the title of her officefrom 'Wife of the President' to 'First Lady'.Throughout her husband’s first tenure, she was addressed as 'Wife ofthe President'.Earlier, Mrs. Buhari had raised the alarm over the deterioratingsecurity situation in the country.During a visit to President Buhari's home state (Katsina), Aisha, whohails from Adamawa State, said it would be unfortunate for people whovoted wholeheartedly for her husband to be allowed to be killedunnecessarily by bandits.She said people must speak out as the killings were worrisome and thatif not tackled they could end up consuming everyone.“When the Katsina SSG spoke out, I sent it to all security outfits inthe country. I told them it’s either they go and help out or allow usall to be killed. It is a must for people to come out and speak.Anything that is not right, people should say it, no matter what,”Mrs. Buhari had said.Four days to the swearing-in of President Buhari for a second, thefirst lady faulted the implementation of the federal government’sSocial Investment Programmes (SIP).At a programme for women at the State House, Abuja, she said the SIPwhich had gulped N470.8 billion, had failed in the North.The SIPs are the N-Power, Conditional Cash Transfers, NationalHome-Grown School Feeding and Government Enterprise and EmpowermentProgrammes (GEEP).Annually, the federal government budgets  N500 billion for social investment.However, in 2016, only  N79.98 billion was released. In 2017, N140billion was made available and in 2018, it was N250.4 billion.Previously, she had attacked her husband’s administration drawing theworldwide's attention when she criticized President Buhari in anOctober 2016 interview with the BBC, saying she feared Buhari's regimewas veering off from its mandate to the people.Mrs. Buhari also expressed doubt that she would support PresidentBuhari if he sought re-election unless he implemented immediatechanges in personnel and policies.But on the eve of this year’s general elections, Mrs. Buhariconstituted a campaign team for President Buhari despite her threats.The team, with about 700 members drawn from across the country, wasinaugurated by President Buhari and played a key role in hisre-election.
