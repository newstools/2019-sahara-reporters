The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to caution the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, from undermine the constitutional powers of the Police Service Commission. HURIWA warned that if the constitutional powers of the commission was not restored and respected, it could lead to misconducts in the commission. HURIWA said, “We are worried that the show of shame by the police authority in refusing to let the PSC discharge its statutory duties could have lasting damage. “This would mean that professional misconducts and indiscipline would rise in the nation’s policing institution. “The PSC Chairman, Musiliu Smith, a retired Inspector-General of Police, was said to have been shocked by the decision of the IGP to release the list when they were yet to resolve the controversy surrounding the suspension of the exercise. This is not good for policing in Nigeria.”
