The Peoples Democratic Party has accused President Muhammadu Buhari of attending the 74th United Nations General Assembly in New York, United States, without any laid out plan and objective. The party also said President Buhari was going with zero capacity to engage other world leaders that would be present at the UNGA. In a statement, the PDP said, “President Muhammadu Buhari is going to the United Nations General Assembly without articulating any definite objectives, plans and proposals to attract tangible benefits to the nation. “Attending such an important meeting of world leaders and policy makers without a clear-cut national agenda shows that the Muhammadu Buhari Presidency is not committed to our nation but only going out for another showboating on the international platform. “Is it not lamentable that while other leaders are heading to the meeting with well-articulated national proposals that will boost their nations' competitiveness on international engagements, the Muhammadu Buhari Presidency is going empty with zero capacity to engage; a clear signal that it will equally return empty?” The PDP, however, urged the President to give an account of how his administration was handling the reported issues of human rights abuse and also speak on alleged rigging and manipulation of the 2019 election that saw him emerge winner. It added, “Nevertheless, since Mr President is appearing before the UNGA, the PDP tasks him to use the opportunity to address world leaders on the reports by the European Union, African Union and other international bodies detailing heavy manipulations and outright rigging of the 2019 general elections to favour him and his party. “Our party also urges Mr President to address the world on reported issues of violations of human rights, disregard to the rule of law and constitutional order, disobedience to court orders, arbitrary arrest and detention of citizens, extrajudicial killings, impunity and swelling corruption under his watch.”
