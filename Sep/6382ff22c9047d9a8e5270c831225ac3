A middle-aged man, Mr. Okon Samson Udofia, has called on the Akwa Ibom State Government for protection against his mentally deranged son. The man claimed his son has become a threat to him and the community. In an interview with The Nation, the man claimed his 20-year-old son burnt down his house while everyone was asleep. He said: ‘’My son, Iniobong, is mentally unwell and I have been crying and asking the police to apprehend him and take him to a psychiatric hospital, but they (police) keep telling me it is not their responsibility to arrest mentally-deranged people. ‘’My son has been very violent to the extent of threatening to kill me and other villagers. Last night, he set ablaze my house while I was sleeping at about 9 pm. ‘’The fire burnt the house and my belongings worth over N500,000. It is by the grace of God that I managed to escape. This is not the first time he has committed this kind of atrocity, ‘’I am taking this opportunity to call on the police and the government to arrest Iniobong and take him to a psychiatric hospital, otherwise, he will wreak more havoc.”
