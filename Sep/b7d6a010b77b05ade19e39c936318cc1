Yinka Odumakin, the spokesman for the Pan-Yoruba group, Afenifere, says the arrest of pro-democracy activist, Omoyele Sowore, is illegal and the charges preferred against him by the Nigerian government are not criminal. Odumakin, while speaking in an interview with SaharaReporters, described the legal battle between Sowore and the President Muhammadu Buhari government as “unfortunate”. He said: “Sowore was arrested before he even committed any offence. He called for a rally, the rally was not allowed to hold. How that now became treason, we are interested in the development in our courts and of court abuse of president is amusing to me. “We were in this country in 2014, 2015when daily attacks were being launched against one president, who at every campaign rally of the APC himself and his wife being abused regularly.nobody was arrested or charged to court for it. APC’s rally was like a festival of insults against President Jonathan and his wife.” Odumakin called on all democracy activists to call for the unconditional released of Sowore. “In protesting that Sowore should be released, we are protecting the freedom of everyone. Therefore, people should speak out and ask the authority and global freedom organisations are alerted about what is going on with SOwore for the freedom of citizens of Nigeria," he stated. Similarly, Joe Odumankin, the President for Centre of Change, condemned the detention of Sowore. “He should have been arraigned 45 days ago instead of detaining him without trial or released on bail until they are ready with charges. We wait to see what constitute insult and its criminalization when the trial starts,” she said. She also called on civil groups to continue to insist on Sowore’s freedom “in protecting libertarian space in the country”.
