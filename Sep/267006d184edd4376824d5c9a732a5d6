  Donald Duke, a former governor of Cross River State, has denied aclaim by the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria that he owed adebt of N569 million.Duke stated that he only owed AMCON N340 million, which he said had been paid.The Federal High Court in Ikoyi, Lagos, has discharged the ordergranted AMCON to take over the property of Duke after he opted for anout-of-court settlement to pay the debt.Counsel to Duke, Edoigiawerie Uyi, told the court that his client hadshown good faith by making payment of over N350 million, which theparties all agreed to.However, Duke, in a statement said the AMCON blew the matter out ofcontrol by approaching the court and claiming that he owed N569million.The statement said, “Recently, an obligation I had to AMCON has madethe news. Whilst I do not understand the excitement this hasgenerated, bearing in mind that debts far in excess of this have notreceived a whisper, clearly some people are having fun at my expense.“Nevertheless, I think it appropriate now that the issue has been laidto rest, to state my side of the matter, considering the fervour thestory generated.“AMCON made a claim of N569 million against me which I disputed. Iguess to arm-twist me they proceeded to court and created a mediacircus. Having done what I consider their worst, I insisted on what Ibelieve is the correct amount. We have since agreed to this amount andthe sum of N340 million has been paid.”The 2019 presidential candidate, however, took a jibe at his attackerssaying, “I hope this takes the wind off the sail of those who made amountain out of a molehill. There was nothing to be excited aboutafter all.”
