 A pressure group, Niger Delta Force, has petitioned President Muhammadu Buhari not to go ahead and appoint a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dennis Otuaro, who is the Delta State's deputy governor's brother and a personal assistant to ex-warlord, Government  Ekpemupolo (Tompolo) as the new coordinator of the Presidential Amnesty Programme. "Mr. President, it has become imperative to draw your attention to the untoward activities by some officials in your government whose selfish interests were undermining your integrity and fight against corruption. And we urge you to be wary of this Dennis Otuaro," NDF said in a statement by its leader, Douglas ZanoIn a statement on Friday by another group, Niger Delta Integrity Network, its president, Clement Goodday, the group said: "It has been speculated all around that a present Minister and former Governor in Niger Delta, in connivance with top and serving military officers are secretly projecting a known member of the Peoples Democratic Party PDP in Delta state, Mr. Dennis Otuaro, to be appointed as Coordinator of the Presidential Amnesty Programme."It added, "Mr. President, it will interest you to know that at the just concluded Presidential election, this same Dennis Otuaro was the Coordinator, Youth Mobilization of the Atiku Abubakar Campaign Organization in Gbaramatu Kingdom, and worked tirelessly for the PDP and Atiku Abubakar."It is also speculated that the proposed appointment of Dennis Otuaro as Coordinator of Amnesty Programme was a planned compensation for Tompolo, an ex-militant that openly supported former Goodluck Jonathan in 2015 and Atiku Abubakar in 2019 respectively against the APC."Mr. President, there are qualified and countless members of APC in Delta State that should be appointed the Coordinator of Amnesty Programme, and certainly not a die-hard and core PDP member, Dennis Otuaro, who is also the younger brother to Deputy Governor of Delta State, Kingsley Otuaro and a confidant and personal assistant to Tompolo, ex-militant leader. "If Dennis Otuaro wants to join the APC in Delta State, the party is open to accommodate him, but not after working against you and APC at the just concluded Presidential election in Gbaramatu kingdom, and in less than five months he wants you to appoint him Coordinator of amnesty program, this is not possible and unacceptable."
