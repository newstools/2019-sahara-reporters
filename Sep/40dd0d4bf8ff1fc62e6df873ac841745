  The Police Service Commission says it will remove the names ofcandidates who did not participate in the recruitment process for10,000 constables, but whose names were added to the final list by thepolice high command.The board explained that a genuine list would be released after thestrange names on the list had been weeded out.A PSC Commissioner, Austin Braimoh, told Punch that the candidates’list that was released by the force was “polluted".It was gathered that the names of genuine candidates were replacedwith those who did not participate in the exercise.A former workers’ union chairman at the police service commission, whospoke on condition of anonymity, said he knew some candidates whoperformed very well in the examinations but whose names were allegedlyremoved during the medical screening by the police over theirinability to pay huge bribes.He said, “I know a candidate in Oyo State whose name was removedduring the medical screening because he had no bribe to give to thepolice officers who handled the exercise. I also know some candidatesin Kogi and Niger states who suffered a similar fate. These are thereports we received from different states.”The union leader explained further, “What the police authorities didwas to lobby members of the National Assembly and Presidencyofficials, collecting names of candidates to back their wrong action.“Those who were invited for medicals were candidates who didn’t applyfor the recruitment. In Niger State where I participated in theprocess, what they did was to add names of candidates who didn’tparticipate in the exercise. Their intention was to screen out theoriginal candidates and replace them with their own people.”The police and the commission had been engaged in a turf war over therecruitment of 10,000 constables with the Inspector-General of Police,Mohammed Adamu, insisting that it was the right of the force toconduct the exercise.He had, consequently, seized the list of candidates who participatedin the recruitment from the commission and went ahead to invite themfor medical screening.Miffed by the development, the PSC Chairman, Musiliu Smith, complainedto President Muhammadu Buhari, who during a meeting on Tuesday, madeit clear to the IG that the commission had the constitutional mandateto handle the recruitment and promotion of personnel in the police.Speaking to Punch in Abuja on Friday, Braimoh said the commissionwould meet with the Deputy Inspector-General in charge of Training andDevelopment, Yakubu Jubrin, to scrutinize the list of candidates thatwas released last week by the police.He said, “We are going to release a more genuine list because the listthe police sent out is polluted. We would have loved to manage it, butwe see what happens. We hope we can put heads together and deletepeople that came in without going through the normal process.”Stressing that the commission would not allow external forces tocorrupt the exercise which was the first recruitment to be carried outby the board, Braimoh explained that only genuine candidates wouldemerge as constables from the process.“This is our first recruitment and we want to ensure we do what isright. We are not accusing them (police) of being corrupt or of doingwhat is wrong, but we would allow Nigerians to judge at the end of theday. This is all that we stand for.“We just want to do what is right. Now that things are being put inthe proper place, we are still going to have a meeting point, sittogether with the DIG Training and all the staff and then look at thelist again, the way we presented it at the initial time and thenstreamline and bring out the best for Nigeria,” the commissionernoted.The PSC board member disclosed that the agency had received reports ofcandidates paying money to scale through the medical screening carriedout by the police nationwide last week.He encouraged candidates who were extorted to report to thecommission, stressing that the board would address the complaints.Braimoh said the commission would hold a meeting with the IG and theMinister of Police Affairs, Alhaji Maigari Dingyadi, where the greyissues surrounding the recruitment crisis would be addressed, addingthat this would determine the next move by the PSC.He also disclosed that President Buhari had approved another round ofrecruitment for next year as part of measures to address theinsecurity in the country.“The President has said that we are going to conduct another round ofrecruitment next year. The figure and the official approval has notbeen released to us, but it is above 10,000 and we are going to worktogether (with the police); we would do it jointly to avoid anyrancour,” he stated.The force spokesman, DCP Frank Mba, could not be reached for reactionto allegations that the police authorities padded the list ofcandidates as calls to his phone rang out. He had yet to respond to atext message on the issue, Punch reports.
