Omoyele Sowore has expressed his readiness to begin the re-arraignment process of the fresh charges laid before him by the Department of State Services and the Nigerian government. Sowore appeared in court for the first time today since he was abducted by the DSS on August 3. Sowore, who is being arraigned before Justice Ijeoma on a seven-count charge, spoke to journalists briefly inside the courtroom. "We are in court, of course to attend to their ridiculous charges and we are ready for them," Sowore said with a smile on his face. The DSS has failed to obey a court order by Justice Taiwo Taiwo to release Sowore on bail following the expiration of the 45-day detention order granted to the DSS.
