Two lovers, Tunde Ogunseye and Funmilayo Oyelaja, have been arrestedfor allegedly hacking into the federal government’s National HealthInsurance Scheme (NHIS) account and stealing N60 million from it.The suspects, who had been on the police wanted list, were said tohave fled to Ghana when the lid was blown on their act.The police alleged that Oyelaja took advantage of being an employee ofClearline International Limited, a health maintenance organization(HMO) based in Lagos, to hack into the account.At the Lagos police headquarters, Ikeja, where the two suspects wereparaded on Wednesday, Oyelaja, a mother of two, told journalists, “Iworked with Clearline International Limited from 2014 to early 2019."What we do there is that we act as the middleman between the NHIS andhospitals. When the NHIS gives us money to pay hospitals, we would notspend all that was given to us and would not refund the excess to theNHIS purse.Ogunseye, denied any involvement in the crime, though he admitted heknew about the alleged fraud.The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Zubairu Muazu, who paraded thesuspects, said they would soon be charged to court.
