Hip-hop artiste, Johnson Oyindamola widely known as Dammy Krane, has been granted bail in the sum of N50,000 with one surety in like sum. He was arraigned at the Igbosere Magistrate Court in Lagos over a three-count allegation bothering on breach of public peace. The musician was accused of making statements capable of breaching public peace and threatening the lives of staff of Merrybet Gold Limited on July 25. According to the prosecutor, the offence contravened sections 301, 412 and 168 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State of Nigeria, 2015. He pleaded not guilty to the charges preferred against him by the police. His lawyer, Adebayo Oniyelu, while applying for his bail, said the defendant was “a well-known musician who had not been convicted of any crime in the past”. He also said that the defendant would not interfere with the prosecution of the matter if granted bail, noting that Dami Krane had been in prison custody since Friday. Opposing the application for bail, prosecuting counsel J. I Enang, said he ordinarily would not have objected to the application for bail if it were not a national issue. But when asked how the case was a national issue, Enang said it would be revealed at the right time. He said, “Your Honour, while coming to court today, I already heard it on the radio that a musician was to be arraigned today, it is even an international issue.” Interjecting, Oniyelu informed the court that the case was one of breach of contract. “The musician performed for the complainant and they are owing to him N1m. “He reached out to them to request for his money but they refused to listen to him, forcing him to go on air to say that they were owing to him. The next thing that happened was his arrest.” The magistrate, A. F. O Botoku, adjourned the matter until October 11 for the commencement of trial.
