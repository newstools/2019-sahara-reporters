Security agents stationed at the United States of America's embassy today (Friday) foiled an attempt by an unidentified man to break into a vehicle at a car park designated for visitors and others who have appointments at the embassy. An eyewitness told SaharaReporters that the car owner had spent the night in the vehicle. The suspected thief, however, did not know the owner was inside it when he broke into it. Upon getting inside the car, the suspect was welcomed with a slap by the owner, asking him what he was looking for. Unable to give any convincing answer, the owner of the vehicle held on to the intruder and called for help. As of the time of filing this report both the name of the alleged thief and the owner of the vehicle could not be ascertained. Meanwhile, the situation has been brought under control by security agents stationed at US Embassy.
