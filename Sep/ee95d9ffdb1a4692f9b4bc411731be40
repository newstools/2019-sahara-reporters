NFF Nigeria A federal high court in Abuja has expressed displeasure at the refusal of four officials of the Nigeria Football Federal (NFF) to appear in court over alleged 8.4 million dollars and N4 billion fraud case.Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu had on July 1, issued a warrant of arrest for the four men following their repeated refusal to appear in court to answer to the fraud case charges against them.The federal government had through the Special Presidential Investigation Panel on the Recovery of Public Property charged them over alleged misappropriation of $8.4 million and N4 billion belonging to the NFF.The five officials are NFF President, Amaju Pinnick’s, NFF Secretary, Sunusi Mohammed; the first Vice-President, Seyi Akinwumi; the second Vice-President, Shehu Dikko and an executive member, Yusuff Fresh, as the first to fifth respondents, respectively.Pinnick was exempted from the ordered arrest due to his official roles as a member of the Confederation of African Football’s organizing committee at the African Cup of Nation in Egypt.Justice Ojukwu said that their duty was to be in court when ordered as the charges against them before the court had not been cancelled. She said that when an order was given, it was expected that such order be obeyed otherwise matters from such agencies will no longer be entertained in her court.“Nobody is bigger than the law,” she said and adjourned the matter until October 5 for arraignment.She requested that all affected parties should be in court.
