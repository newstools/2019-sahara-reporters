Trinidad and Tobago-born American rapper, Nicki Minaj, has said that she has decided to retire from music to have a family. The 36-year-old made the announcement on Thursday through her Twitterhandle @nickiminaj. She said, “I’ve decided to retire and have my family. I know you guys are happy now. “To my fans, keep ‘reppin’ me, love you for life.” During a radio show in August, the musician had hinted that she and boyfriend, Kenneth Petty, will be married “in 80 days.” Following her announcement of quitting music on Thursday, there are suggestions that Minaj could be walking down the aisle any moment from now. A gifted artiste, Minaj’s solo albums have sold millions as well as her collaborations with Ludacris, Usher, David Guetta, Madonna, Ariana Grande, Kanye West and Justin Bieber. In recognition of her works, the 36-year-old has been nominated for 10 Grammys, won five MTV Video Music Awards and broken the record for the most Billboard Hot 100 entries by a solo female artist.
