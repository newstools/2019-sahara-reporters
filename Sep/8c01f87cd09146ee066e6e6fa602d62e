  Dr. Chris Ngige, Nigeria's labour and employment minister, says theplague of Boko Haram, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) andbandits in Nigeria is a symptom of jobless people.“When you hear about Boko Haram, that is one of the symptoms, when youhear about banditry and IPOB, it is one of the symptoms of joblesspeople. So, for me, the President has decided that we must fightunemployment. We have to fight because the indices are terrible andthat does not call for cheers.“We have to decide and wear our thinking cap and take our country awayfrom the doldrums. The President is committed to recreating the middleclass in Nigeria. He is committed to lifting at least 100 millionpeople out of poverty and the only way if for our economy to improve,"he explained.According to Ngige, President Muhammadu Buhari is committed to lifting100 million people out of poverty.The minister added, “What we are here to do his national service.Anybody who is a minister of the federal republic is on nationalservice. Most of the jobs we did in the ministry are to prevent jobloss, especially in the oil industry. We have seen the symptom calledunemployment, which is very visible.“When our economy improves, we would deal a big blow to poverty,social insecurity and also the insecurity of lives and property. Wehave to make our country a better place because we cannot run awayfrom that. We all have a collective responsibility."We have a situation now where you have the topmost rich who are veryrich and those at the bottom. Even down there at the bottom, you stillhave people who cannot be compartmentalized into the middle class.“Those who are work in Nigeria, the government is trying its best. Wehave many programmes that have kept people at work. We have refusedredundancy being declared, we are fighting casualization and we arenot happy with contract appointment."We don't want contract appointments in the private sector. We wantpeople given their jobs with full benefits.”
