Former Vice-President of Nigeria, Atiku Abubakar, has called on the Nigerian Government to take urgent steps in responding to xenophobic attacks against Nigerians in South Africa. In a tweet on Monday, Abubakar said, “Reported attacks against Nigerians in South Africa is unacceptable and stands condemned. “Urgent steps need to be taken with the SA authorities and the African Union to bring an end to this ill wind that can only end up destroying the fabric of our African brotherhood.” Former lawmaker, Shehu Sani, while reacting to the development, urged President Muhammadu Buhari to confront the ‘bully’ in South Africa with "barking" approach. In a post on Twitter, he said, “Sometimes our response to xenophobia is that of turning the other cheek and sometimes that of playing the barking dog in the face of a bully.” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Nigerian Diaspora Commission, Abike Dabiri-Erewa, said legal access must be granted to victims of xenophobic attacks at the African Court to ensure justice is served. She said, “On the killings in South Africa, Nigeria through the Minister of Foreign Affairs must make a declaration to allow the government and dependents of the deceased to access the African Court on Human and Peoples Rights.”
