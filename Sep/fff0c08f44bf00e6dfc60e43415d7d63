The presidential election petitions tribunal will in a matter of hours today decide if President Muhammdu Buhari actually won the 2019 presidential poll or Atiku Abubakar was the legitimate winner. Since the notice became public, Nigerians have spared no comment in anticipation of the judgment. Supporters of President Buhari of the All Progressive Congress (APC) and that of Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have been trending #AtikuBusted and #Atiku hashtags, respectively on Twitter. Tosin Olaluwoye who tweets @tosin_olaluwoye said today's judgment was the first phase as the case might drag up to the Supreme Court. “Today is really not the end of the presidential election wahala. Regardless of who the #PEPT declares winner today, those saying #AtikuIsComing and those saying #AtikuBusted (and NOT coming) will have to wait for the supreme court judgment. May Nigeria win,” he said. Other more partisan supporters are hopeful that the judgment would further scuttle Abubakar’s ambition. “Today is the day that the Lord has made. Judgment day. Thanking God Almighty because #AtikuIsNotComing because #AtikuHasNoCase as #AtikuBusted several times,” ‘Kunle Adeniran tweeted. Another user, Kenneth Cole tweeted, “Today! Today!! pesin go cry sooteeeeey!!!#AtikuIsNotComing #AtikuHasNoCase #AtikuBusted.” Similarly, Benard Loveth @Benardloveth said, “Atiku will finally enter RELIGATION tomorrow.” However, some others are hopeful that “Atiku is coming”. Eze Otuonye, @ezejeanpaul, tweeted: “#AtikuIsComing The solution for the judges is cancel the Feb 19th election Give a 60 days to conduct fresh presidential elections, give Buhari a warning to present original weac in 60 days or forfeit contesting while Buhari is confused, elections held and Atiku wins.” “Today I'll know whether it's safer for somebody to choose a path as a bus conductor or as someone that will end up in this gown/wig. They call them lawyers but by end of today, I'll have a name for them. #AtikuIsComing is not about Atiku but about JUST WEIGHT for #Nigeria,” Ayemojubar said. Grace Okagbare also tweeted: “Dear Daddy @atiku In d public court, you have obviously been served justice as d winner of the presidential poll. And at the tribunal, one thing is now clear and would be registered in our history forever; Nigeria was raped & you rose to the occasion to save her. #AtikuIscoming.”
