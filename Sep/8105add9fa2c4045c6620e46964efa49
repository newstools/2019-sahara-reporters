Nigeria's Vice-President, Yemi Osinbajo, has said that he has noticed that Nigerians usually call him out especially whenever he uploads a picture of him with President Muhammadu Buhari on the Internet. Reacting to the situation in a post on Twitter, Osinbajo said, “I see quite a few memes that "roast" me on social media and to be honest, I find some of them creative and funny. “For example, it appears every photograph of me talking to the President must be characterised as though I am saying something mischievous. “I am a firm believer in the freedom of press whether it is responsible press or irresponsible press. What is often lacking though is the deliberate or advertent lack of curiosity about facts. “See the issue on the President's WAEC certificate, one would have thought that a simple investigation by the media houses would establish the truth or falsehood of the matter. “With the ubiquity and anonymity of social media, everyday problems of a free press are becoming complex. “There was a video of an occurrence in India showing some people jumping out of a burning high-rise building in May. “This provocative and fake video had a woman cursing the President and I, our families and generations. “My elderly aunt called me in February just before the elections and asked why I resigned. “I told her I didn't but she was convinced and insisted I did because she had read it on WhatsApp. Media is powerful, social media is perhaps, even more so.”
