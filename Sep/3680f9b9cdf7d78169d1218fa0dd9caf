No fewer than 12,405 internally displaced persons have been schemed out of a World Bank intervention in Adamawa State by officials of the global financial institutionâ€™s assisted programme. The affected IDPs from Michika and Madagali local government areas of the state were allegedly omitted from the scheme by fraudulent officials of the Youth Employment and Social Support Operations of the Adamawa State Government, who attempted to replace them with fictitious names. But the Adamawa State Government swiftly responded and fired some staff including Coordinator of the scheme, Jika Abdulhamid. Abdulhamid's sack followed the discovery of fictitious names on YESSO database from, which targeted beneficiaries of the World Bank's social support intervention were to be mined. Task Team Leader of World Bank Programmes in Nigeria, Folusho Okunmadewa, also discovered that the YESSO programme in Adamawa had excluded 12,405 IDPs out of the 20,805 captured in the unified social register of vulnerable persons including those from Michika and Madagali. The discovery further revealed that the operations of YESSO had failed to target actual vulnerable persons in the state. But Abdulhamid while addressing journalists, denied that he was sacked for engaging in fraudulent practice. He also denied scheming out 12,405 IDPs, who were to receive N150,000 each as grant from the World Bank to help them rebuild their lives after Boko Haram attacks. Abdulhamid stated that the exclusion of 12, 405 IDPs from Michika and Madagali was due to disorderly conduct of the displaced persons when officials from the project implementation unit visited the communities for verification.
