It would be recalled that Elizabeth was accosted by a gang of five stern-looking young men along the popular Anwai Road, near Temple Clinic Restaurant Junction, few metres away from the Government House gate and was whisked away in a waiting vehicle. Confiding in our correspondent, a senior police office in the Delta State Command, who pleaded for anonymity, disclosed that, “The negotiations for the release of the young lady was kept top secret but she was released by 2:00am on Thursday after huge ransom was paid.
