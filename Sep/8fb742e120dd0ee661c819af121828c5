The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ibadan Zonal Office, has arrested one Kehinde Agbabiaka, a sales agent with Fidelity Bank Plc, for allegedly diverting N137m belonging to a customer to personal use. Agbabiaka was supported in the fraudulent act by his bankâ€™s Regional Security Officer and Cluster Control and Compliance Manager. According to a petition filed against him on August 20, 2019 by the client, Agbabiaka committed the offence between January 2017 and July 2019 when he was the account officer of the victim. Trouble, however, started when the customer reviewed his statement of account and discovered some discrepancies. When EFCC investigators stepped into the case after the agency was petitioned, it was revealed that Agbabiaka had used the diverted sum to build houses, purchase cars, invest in fixed deposits and insurance policies. He also gave out part of the loot to people as friendly loans. Some items had been recovered from him and will be charged to court after investigations are completed, the EFCC said.
