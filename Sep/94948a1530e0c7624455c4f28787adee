Nobel laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka, says the President MuhammaduBuhari regime has attained an “unprecedented level of paranoia”following the charges of treason filed against human rights activist,Omoyele Sowore.In a statement on Saturday, Soyinka said the nation had failed tolearn from past experiences.He said, “This is utterly depressing news. So, the Sowore affair hasmoved beyond harassment and taken on a sinister direction. Outside thecountry where I happened to be engaged at the moment, I can testifythat the immediate reaction around me was to dismiss this as yetanother grotesque product of fake news, of which Nigerians have becomethe greatest practitioners. I confess that I also joined in thisschool of thought – at the start.“Further checks have however confirmed that this government has indeedattained an unprecedented level of paranoia. I do not believe that thejustice department itself believes in these improbable charges, asformally publicized."So, once again, we inscribe in our annals another season oftreasonable felony. History still guards some lessons we have yet todigest, much less from which to learn. Welcome to the Club, Mr.Omoyele Sowore.”The Buhari regime had on Friday filed seven counts of treasonablefelony and money laundering against Sowore.The charges were filed a day before the expiration of the detentionorder of the Federal High Court in Abuja permitting the Department ofState Services to keep the activist for 45 days.
