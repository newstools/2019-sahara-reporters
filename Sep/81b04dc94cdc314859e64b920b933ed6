The Coalition for Revolution, organisers of the #RevolutionNow protest, has issued guidelines to protesters willing to take part in peaceful demonstrations nationwide on September 18. Events organised by the movement since August 5 had been met with fierce resistance from the Nigerian Government and in some cases, violence on journalists and protesters. Co-conveners of the group, Seni Ajai and Baba Aye, told SaharaReporters on Monday that the guidelines are to ensure orderly conduct on the part of protesters and to show the President Muhammadu Buhari administration that it is a non-violent group demanding good governance in Nigeria. The group said, “All protesters should assemble at a venue/time decided by the local coordinating team. “Modalities should be designed to have access to centres for open address and solidarity talks. “Provisions should be made for distribution of leaflets and display of banners. Pre-arrangement should be made for media coverage. “All conducts should be peaceful. For briefing and or other needs, coordinators are to link up with the national hub on assigned numbers."
