The regime of President Muhammadu Buhari has been adjudged as being "lawless" and "disobedient", an online poll says. The poll conducted on social media by Punch asked if Nigerians considered the persistent disobedience of court orders by the Buhari regime as an act of lawlessness. Eighty-three percent of the 9,682 people who participated in the poll agreed that the government was lawless by ignoring orders from courts of competent jurisdiction. Sambo Dasuki, a former boss of the National Security Agency, has been in the detention of the Department of State Services since 2015 despite multiple court orders for his release. Similarly, Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, the leader of the now proscribed Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) and his wife Zeenat, have been in the government's detention facility for about three years. The latest disregard for the rule of law and court orders was the unlawful detention of Omoyele Sowore, a pro-democracy activist. Sowore was arrested in Lagos by DSS operatives and has been detained for 53 days. Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Federal High Court in Abuja would later ordered his release but the order was not obeyed by the DSS.
