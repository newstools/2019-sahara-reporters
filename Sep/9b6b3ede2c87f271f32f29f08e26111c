The Nigerian Army has asked residents and visitors in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states to always have a means of identification on them. The Army said this in a statement on Sunday as the  Theatre Command of Operation Lafiya Dole launched “Operation Positive Identification” against fleeing Boko Haram/ISWAP terrorists in the North-East. Deputy Director, Army Public Relation, Ado Isa, urged the public to always carry valid means of identification when moving or passing through the three states. Isa said the operation was aimed at searching for and arresting all suspected terrorists that currently roam some parts of the North-East. This, according to him, has become necessary following credible information that some of the fleeing criminals are hibernating in some towns and villages of Borno and Yobe states in particular and North-East in general. He said, “We, therefore enjoin all to fully cooperate with troops and security agencies in carrying out this exercise. “The Theatre Command also wishes to state that anyone not positively identified will attract further scrutiny and comprehensive investigation to determine his or her activities with the insurgents or otherwise. “The general public is requested to bear with this measure as it is in their best interest and our national security, as well as efforts to end the madness called insurgency as perpetrated by Boko Haram/ISWAP fighters.”
