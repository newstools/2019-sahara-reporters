APC vs PDP cartoon A middle-aged supporter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Best Uduophori, has allegedly stabbed a loyalist of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Elvis Omoiri, for celebrating the victory of President Muhammadu Buhari at the presidential election petitions tribunal. According to an eyewitness, Omoiri, had gone to a beer parlour belonging to Uduophori at Okolona, Effurun in Warri on Thursday a day after the court judgment to have a drink with friends to celebrate Buhari's victory when he was reportedly stabbed by the owner of the joint, who is a PDP. Trouble started when Omoiri expressed his delight at the judgment. But Uduophori disagreed with him. Angered, the PDP loyalist broke a bottle and stabbed the APC supporter. "Best has his beer parlour in front of Elvis compounded and before now Best has always antagonized Elvis because of their political differences and while discussing they had this disagreements and stabbed Elvis everywhere and was even resisting those who tried to rush Elvis to the hospital. "Elvis is an Isoko boy from Ivrogbo-irri, Isoko South local government area of Delta state and a die hard believer of the Buhari APC led government," the eyewitness said.
