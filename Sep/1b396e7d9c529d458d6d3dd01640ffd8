Chris Ngige, the minister of labour and employment, says some stategovernments are not proactive in preparation for payment of the newminimum wage once negotiations are finalized.He also revealed that President Muhammadu Buhari had directed therelevant government officials and agencies to expedite action on theConsequential Adjustment Negotiations on Minimum Wage.He also approved the constitution of the Presidential Committee onSalaries and Allowances to handle all requests after the conclusion ofConsequential Adjustment Negotiations.Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, disclosed this whenthe Labour Correspondents Association of Nigeria paid him a courtesyvisit.Ngige said: “My department of the inspectorate, as well as employmentand wage, are going to do more. We are going to fund them so that wecan start full factory inspection and make sure that nobody isunderemployed and that those in employment get what they deserve inthe world of work, so they can have decent work.“Part of it is the new minimum wage, which the president signed inApril. It is a pity that after signing it, May came and a lot of uswere sent on compulsory leave. We are now coming back from leave. Ifyou remember, a committee was set up and I was a member.“When we left, the permanent secretary took our place and werenegotiating with the joint negotiating council on the consequentialadjustment. The states are waiting for that and it is not proper forus not to fast-track that negotiation so that even the states will nothave too much backlog to pay when the consequential adjustment isconcluded.“We have our own budgeted for in the 2019 budget and we are going toalso budget for it in the 2020 budget. We are concerned about thestates because some of the states are not proactive like us.“So, the sooner we conclude at the federal level and the jointnegotiating councils in the states take it from there and negotiatewith the states the better for everybody. If it spills this into nextyear, I am not sure how many states will be able to pay the backlogwhich will lead us to another round of negotiation.”Ngige added, “It is the determination of the president and thisadministration to fast-track the negotiation on consequentialadjustment. I have just received a correspondence from the chief ofstaff to the president and we are putting a deadline to thatnegotiation.“We are fast-tracking it because the government will also want to putin place a presidential committee on salaries and allowances that willbe able to take request after this consequential adjustment."
