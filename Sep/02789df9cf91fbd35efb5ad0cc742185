  Research by a UK-Nigerian research team examining the role of WhatsAppin Nigeria’s 2019 elections has identified the opportunities andthreats posed by the messaging platform for Nigeria’s democraticprocess.Drawing on citizen surveys and interviews with political campaigns,the report underlines the ways in which WhatsApp has promoted thespread of “fake news” around elections, but has also strengthenedaccountability and promoted inclusion in other areas.Researchers from the Centre for Democracy and Development (Nigeria)and the University of Birmingham (UK) recently presented key findingsfrom a WhatsApp-sponsored research project on the role of WhatsApp inNigeria’s 2019 elections.WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app in 40 African countries,including Nigeria, due to its low cost, encrypted messages, and theability to easily share messages with both individuals and groups.According to the team, the aim of the research project was to shedlight on how the app is influencing Nigerian elections, particularlyin light of concerns – in Nigeria, and across the globe – about socialmedia usage and the spread of so-called “fake news”.Dr. Jonathan Fisher (University of Birmingham) led the research team,which included Idayat Hassan (Centre for Democracy and Development),Jamie Hitchen (Independent Consultant) and Professor Nic Cheeseman(University of Birmingham).With a particular focus on governorship races in Oyo and Kano, theresearch found that: the political use of WhatsApp is becomingincreasingly sophisticated and organized at the state and presidentiallevel.A statement by the research team noted that by setting up multipleoverlapping WhatsApp groups, organizations such as the Buhari NewMedia Centre (BNMC) and Atikulated Youth Force (AYF) – set up tosupport, respectively, the campaigns of President Buhari and his mainopponent, Atiku Abubakar – can send messages to tens of thousands ofpeople at the touch of a button by forming hundreds of groups of 256members.The research also observed that things look very different below thenational level, however, where a significant proportion of activityremains informal.This limits the ability of formal structures like parties to set andcontrol narratives at the local level.Research team lead, Dr. Fisher, said of the findings: “Our researchshows that while WhatsApp replicates existing political patron-clientnetworks to some extent, it is also helping less traditionalpower-players to enter the political arena – particularly tech-savvyyouth.”Subsequently, the researchers observed that the different types ofcontent shared via WhatsApp have varying impacts depending on who theyhave been shared by, and how they are presented to the user.Idayat Hassan a member of the research team, and Director at theCentre for Democracy and Development observed that:“the format, style,source and the content of a piece of information shared or received onWhatsApp all have a critical impact on how far they reach, and how farthey are believed...pictures and videos are increasingly influential.”Another key issue, which the report brings to the fore has to do withthe nature of networks, deploying WhatsApp as a tool to influencepolitical behaviour.It notes that offline and online structures are interlinked,reinforcing and building on each other in ways that are important tounderstand.As a result, in many respects, WhatsApp amplifies the significance andinfluence of networks that already exist within Nigerian politics andsociety.Another member of the research team Jamie Hitchen noted, “Theinteraction between information shared on WhatsApp and the offlinecontext is a crucial part of the digital eco-system, and challengesclaim that the platform has revolutionized political campaigning.”However, in terms of impact, the research found that WhatsApp is usedto both spread disinformation, and to counter it. An example is foundin one of the most notorious messages of the election – the falsestory that President Buhari had died and been replaced by a clone fromSudan.The story was widely circulated on WhatsApp. But candidates also usedWhatsApp to alert citizens to false stories and to “set the recordstraight”.This point was stressed by Prof. Cheeseman of the University ofBirmingham, who said: “Social media platforms are both a threat todemocracy and a way to strengthen it. WhatsApp is being used to spread“fake news” on the one hand, and run fact-checking campaigns andelection observation on the other. The challenge is to reduce riskswithout undermining the way that social media can strengthenaccountability and promote inclusion.”Based on these findings, the research went on to proffer long andshort term recommendations to wade off the threats, while harnessingthe opportunities posed by Whatsapp to the democratic process.The research recommends that in the short-term, possibilities shouldbe explored to make it easier for individuals to leave WhatsApp groupsand report disinformation while reinforcing the ability of groupadministrators to set standards.The research also talks about targeting digital literacy training tosocial influencers and strengthen WhatsApp’s ability to understand therisk of misuse by opening an office in the African continent."In the longer-term, state and federal governments should invest morein digital literacy as part of the national curriculum, whilepolitical campaigns should develop social media codes of conduct forfuture elections. Online protection of data and civil liberties shouldalso be enhanced in Nigeria, and beyond,” the team recommended.
