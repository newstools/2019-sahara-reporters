The Controller, Federal Ministry of Works in Anambra State, Adeyemo Ajani, has said the second Niger bridge may suffer a serious setback if the government does not intervene urgently in the crisis between the contractors and host communities as well as workers.Ajani, in an interview with Daily Trust, said work had stopped on the second Niger bridge and if there is no quick intervention, it might affect the scheduled date of completion.According to him, work stopped at the site because communities are demanding projects worth N500 million, while workers are seeking promotion and increase in allowances.The controller added that the project did not have any issues in terms of funding, but that the communities were trying to delay its completion.Some communities from Anambra and Delta states stopped work at the site, alleging that the project manager "has not given them their dues".Ajani, said, ‘‘Each community is demanding a project worth N50 million and by the time it is calculated, it will amount to N500 million. Where can such money come from?"Even the Works Tender Board cannot approve that kind of money. It is only the government that can address it and that is why we are seeking its intervention”.He noted that the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the communities and the contractors had yet to be  signed due to the demands.
