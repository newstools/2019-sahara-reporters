Reputed for his disdain and arrogance, former Oyo State Governor, Abiola Ajimobi, has lost his battle to join the horde of ex-governors in the Nigerian senate. He lost the bid to become a senator at the election petitions tribunal sitting in Ibadan, the capital of Oyo. The tribunal on Tuesday dismissed his petition challenging the victory of Senator Kola Balogun in the Ibadan South senatorial district election. The tribunal held that Ajimobi failed to prove all the allegations of corruption against the lawmaker. It noted that a margin of 13,502 votes between the votes cast for Balogun and Ajimobi, adding that the discrepancy of 11,759 votes alleged by the APC was far lesser than the difference. He held that even if the 11,759 was deducted from the total difference of 13,502 votes, Balogun still led by 1,743 votes. The tribunal added that Ajimobi rested his case on card reader malfunction which could not invalidate the accreditation of voters. In a related development, the tribunal in another judgment delivered by Justice Sambo Daka upheld the victory of Senator Fatai Buhari in the Ibadan North senatorial district election. It dismissed the petition filed by a former majority leader in the federal parliament, Mulikat Akande, challenging Buhariâ€™s election. Justice Daka held that Adeola and her party, PDP, failed to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt to warrant cancellation of the election held in the senatorial district.
