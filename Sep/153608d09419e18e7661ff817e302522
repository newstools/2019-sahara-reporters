A High Court in London, United Kingdom, has rejected a suit challenging Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s decision to suspend parliament for five weeks ahead of Queen’s speech on October 14. Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour and other parties agreed not to support Johnson’s general election demand before the European Union Summit. The Mail Online reported that Labour will block Johnson’s plans for an early general election until November after entering into a pact with the SNP to stop a ‘No Deal’ exit. According to the newspaper, Corbyn held a secret meeting with Ian Blackford, the Scottish nationalists’ Westminster leader, to agree an election should only be held after Britain has secured another Brexit delay from the EU. Johnson is expected to go for broke on Monday and call for a general election again after he was resisted by the Commons earlier in the week. The court said the case could still be taken to the Supreme Court for a final appeal.
