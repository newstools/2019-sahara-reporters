The Human and Environmental Rights Agenda has accused the Central Bankof Nigeria, headed by Godwin Emefiele, of trying to hide the detailsof its agreement with telecommunication giant, MTN, relating to thepayment of $8 billion fine imposed on the firm.With the "outright refusal" of the CBN to release the requestedinformation to the civil society group, an action, in accordance withthe F0I provisions, was filed by the organisation against the bankbefore the Abuja Division of the Federal High Court.The CBN was last given seven days, as provided under the FoI Act, 2011to produce the details of the deal or face legal actions.HEDA had in January this year requested for details of the resolutionbetween Central Bank of Nigeria and MTN Nigeria on the improperrepatriation of fund allegations against MTN.HEDA had invoked the Freedom of Information Act 2011 demanding for therelease of details of the CBN agreement with MTN amidst widespeculations that the deal was dotted with questionable clauses.HEDA in a letter signed by its Chairman, Mr. Olanrewaju Suraju, inJanuary made the request in line with the Freedom of Information Act2011 which in Section 4 states that within 7 days of the receipt of aFreedom of Information request, the desired information requested forbe supplied."We are interested in the details of the agreement. It is in theinterest of Nigerians to know. The CBN is owned by the Nigerianpeople. MTN performs functions that impact on millions of Nigerians.The agreement between the CBN and MTN should not be a secret document.It has to be made public. This is the HEDA position," Suraju said madeavailable to SaharaReporters on Sunday.The Nigerian authorities had asked mobile telecommunications firm,MTN, to pay $8.1 billion as the CBN accused the South African giant ofillegally moving the funds in contravention of foreign exchangeregulations.The CBN asked the company to return the $8.1 billion "to the coffersof the CBN".MTN had denied any wrongdoing after which it went to court challengingthe fine. This led to an out-of-court settlement with the MTN payingabout $53 million which the group said had ended the four-month-oldrow.In its series of follow-up letters, HEDA asked the CBN to come up withdetails of the agreement with the communication giant.In a string of terse acknowledgments, the CBN consistently hinged itsrefusal to reply to a lingering court case at the Abuja Division ofthe Federal High Court, (FHC).In its latest letter, the CBN had stated: "In line with the provisionof paragraph 12.3.1 of the revised Guidelines on the implementation ofthe Freedom of Information Act 2011 refer to suit FHC/CS/1475/2018 atthe Abuja Division of the Federal High Court where MTN had earlierinstituted a legal action and the national dailies at the NationalLibrary to obtain the information are the public."The statement was signed by the Director of Corporate Secretariat, Mr.C.O Olonta.HEDA fired back in another letter in April rejecting the CBN position.In another letter, HEDA said: "Consequent upon the above, we have yetto receive the promised information two months down the line. Wetherefore humbly urge you to oblige us with the details of our requestin our letter dated  7 January 2019 in line with the provisions ofSection 4 of the Freedom of Information Act, 2011.""First and foremost, the section being referred to in Paragraph12.3.1, Section 26 of the Freedom of Information Act, 2011 states that"the Act does not apply to- (a)  published material or materialavailable for purchase by the public; (b)  library or museum materialmade or acquired and preserved solely for public reference orexhibition purposes; or (c) material placed in the National Library,National Museum or non- public section of the National Archives of theFederal Republic of Nigeria on behalf of any person or organizationother than a government or public institution."It stated "We most humbly state that paragraph 12.3.1 does not dealwith the information being requested, as it relates to the definitionof Section 26 of the Freedom of Information Act, 2011"HEDA noted further, "Also, it is worthy of note that chapter 12,particularly, paragraph 12.3 of the Guidelines which states that'There is only one question to be considered when dealing with Section26. Is the material listed under this section? If it is, then thematerial is exempt from the Act. If the information is not listed inthe section, then the public institution should deal with theapplication in accordance with the Act'."The group added, "It is on the above basis that we are making thisrequest, as we believe that the records and details of the saidresolution made available will aid the investigations of ourOrganisation. Thus, this application is brought pursuant to theprovisions of Section 2, 3, and 4 of the Freedom of Information Act,2011."
