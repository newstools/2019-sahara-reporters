A coalition of labour and trade unions have vowed to frustrateNigeria’s fish and fertilizer trade agreement with Morocco.In a press briefing on Wednesday, the 20-organization strongpartnership – Nigerian Movement for the Liberation of Western Sahara(NMLWS), accused Rabat of selling phosphate and seafood from theSaharawi Arab Democratic Republic to Nigeria.The group chaired by Ibrahim Gambari, Nigeria’s former foreign affairsminister, said it would picket companies in Nigeria that processfertilizer from phosphate supplied by Morocco.“We put all those dealing in stolen Western Sahara natural resourcesincluding their fishes on notice that they cannot continue to dobusiness as usual,” the group stated.“After giving this notice to the Nigerian companies dealing in stolenWestern Sahara resources, we will picket them across the country andbring them before our courts. This also includes supermarkets sellingsardines and fishes from Morocco because   92 percent of these fishesare stolen from the Western Sahara coast. The group accused PresidentMuhammadu Buhari of supporting the self-declaration of independence bythe Western Saharan state in 1984 and doing the opposite 35 yearslater.“Nigeria in December 1984 then led by General Muhammadu Buhari,recognized the SADR as an independent African country. This was afterthe Saharawi had thrown off the colonial yoke of Spain.  It is,therefore, inconceivable that 35 years later, under an electedPresident Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria would tolerate the occupation ofthe same country by a sister African country and be receiving thenatural resources of Western Sahara plundered by Morocco,” it added.The President Muhammadu Buhari administration had in December 2016,reached an agreement with the state-owned Moroccan firm OCP, toproduce 1 million tons of locally manufactured fertilizer annually.The memorandum of understanding signed with the company included thesupply of raw materials for fertilizer production such as phosphate.The group insisted that while it wanted Nigeria to develop itsfertiliser capacity, it will not permit the use of stolen resources.It stated further, “This movement supports the development of Nigeria,but not with stolen resources. We insist that although our countryneeds fertilizer, but not that produced with the blood of our brothersand sisters in Western Sahara. About this, we are definite. Thisprinciple is planted in the Nigerian culture of non-exploitation ofother peoples and defender of colonized peoples as we did in thestruggle for the liberation of countries like Guinea Bissau,Mozambique, Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, and South Africa.”Despite a 1975 judgment denouncing Morocco’s claim to SADR by theInternational Court of Justice, Morocco went on to forcefully occupythe territory. After a bloody war, Moroccan forces pushed most of itspopulation into refugee camps in Algeria.Morocco left the Organisation of African Unity now African Union in1984, for recognizing the independence of SADR. It recently rejoinedthe AU but is still laying claim to the mineral-reach Western Sahara.
