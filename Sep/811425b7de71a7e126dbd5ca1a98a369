The tribunal has struck out the application of INEC challenging the PDP petition for listing police, army and others to have committed serious crimes and manipulated the February 28 Presidential election without making them party to the petition. Instead, the tribunal struck out all the paragraphs where the allegation of crime against the police, army and others were mentioned.
