There is pandemonium at Lugbe along airport road Abuja as police engaged some youths planning to burn down one of the South African businesses, Shoprite, in Nigeria. The youths were tear-gassed by policemen in a bid to foil their attempt to set the mall ablaze. Meanwhile, the irate protesters have set a bonfire on the road, vowing not to leave the area as more armed policemen were deployed to the area to restore order. Hundreds of motorists were stranded on the road.
