A Kano-based group, the Renaissance Coalition, says there are plans bythe Kano State government to remove Emir Muhammadu Sanusi II from KanoEmirate.The group claimed that Governor Abdullahi Ganduje was plotting to postthe emir to Bichi Emirate.But Kano government, through its Chief Press Secretary, Abba Anwar,said there was no attempt to act against Sanusi.In a statement on Thursday by Renaissance Coalition signed by itsspokesperson, Ibrahim A. Waiya, the group alleged that the plotincluded an attempt to depose Emir Sanusi."It has come to the notice of the Renaissance Coalition that the KanoState government has a plan to send the Emir of Kano, Muhammadu SanusiII to Bichi; and in the event he resists, he will be deposed."However, in the event that the governor refuses to heed the goodcounsel and goes ahead to actualize the dastardly agenda, we will beleft with no other option than to call on the federal government todeclare a state of emergency in Kano State.“It is quite unfortunate that such a plot is being hatched despite asubsisting court ruling which has ordered that status quo should bemaintained pending the conclusion of the matter before it.“This is indeed a very dangerous move and it is likely to cause unrestwithin the polity. The alleged plot also shows efforts on the part ofthe governor to advance a personal vendetta at the expense of thepeace and wellbeing of the citizens he swore to protect."We deem it our responsibility to do everything possible within ourpower to advocate for the peace and well-being of the citizens bycalling on all well-meaning individuals and the federal government tourge the governor to desist from any further action against the Kanoemirate and Emir Sanusi ll,” the group said.
