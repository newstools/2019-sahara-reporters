Total French oil multinational, Total, on Tuesday said that it would take a Final Investment Decision on Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd’s train seven project at the end of the year. Reuters reports that Arnaud Breuillac, the company’s head of production, said it expects gas to start flowing from the new processing plant by 2023. NLNG had earlier in September signed a letter of intent for the Engineering, Procurement and Construction of the new processing plant with the SCD consortium. The building of the new plant is expected to cost $10bn. The train seven project was unable to gain any traction last year but 2019 has turned out to be generally profitable for gas projects. Breuillac had at the New York announcement noted that the company intends to expand the gas production in energy portfolio from 14 per cent to 25 per cent.
