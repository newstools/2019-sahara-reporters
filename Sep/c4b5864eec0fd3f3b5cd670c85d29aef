Wikipedia  Nigeria’s major carrier, Air Peace has warned people about scammersallegedly asking Nigerians in South Africa to pay some money to beevacuated from the country.The airline insisted that it was offering a free flight to Nigerianswho wish to return home and urged them not to pay for the service.The airline gave the warning in reaction to the disturbing report thatsome people had been collecting $1,000 Nigerians seeking to return toNigeria via Air Peace flight.A Nigerian living in South Africa inquired from Air Peace to confirmwhether the flight is free because some people were already collectingmoney for the flight.A Nigerian in South Africa, Fred Okeke, had written to the airline,“We heard that you are donating the flight for free evacuation fromSouth Africa to Nigeria, but it is very unfortunate to hear that theyare asking the affected victims to pay the sum of $1000 asregistration to be eligible to benefit from the fight. So I want tobring it to your notice.”But Air Peace Chairman, Allen Onyema, said, “We are offering a freetrip to Nigerians in South Africa to return home after going throughthe traumatic experience of the attacks. Air Peace has said this isfree and we are doing it in solidarity with the federal government.“We have not designated or recruited any agent in South African tocollect money on behalf of Air Peace. So nobody should pay money toanyone or group of persons posing as Air Peace agent or staff. AnyNigerian who has paid money for repatriation back to Nigeria with AirPeace should request a refund and report to appropriate authorities.”
