 The African Action Congress has called on the Nigerian Government to withdraw all charges brought up against pro-democracy campaigner and Convener of RevolutionNow movement, Omoyele Sowore, and others still being detained by law enforcement agencies. Making the call on Tuesday after the Federal High Court in Abuja ordered the Department of State Services to immediately release Sowore on bail, AAC head of legal team, Tope Akinyode, said that the charges brought against Sowore has no basis. He said, “We submit that the reasoning of the court in granting liberty to Omoyele Sowore is impeccable. “It is our contention that when justice is certain and mild as we have seen today, hope is renewed in the common man. “We hail the judge for his legal erudition and industry in this matter. Law is sacrosanct, law is saintly; the law knows no partisan politics and never should justice be for sale. “Our other demand is that the government should immediately withdraw all the charges against Omoyele Sowore and Olawale Adebayo. “Insulting the President can never amount to a criminal offence. The government should focus on good governance which is its ultimate task.” Sowore was arrested in Lagos on August 3, 2019 by operatives of the DSS for calling on Nigerians to pour out to the streets to express their anger at the poor state of governance in the country.
