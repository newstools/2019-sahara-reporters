Femi Adesina, the Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, says the presidency has kept mum on the ongoing legal battle between the Department of State Services and Omoyele SOwore, a pro-democracy activist because it is too early for the president to intervene. Adesina said this during an interview with ChannelsTV. Sowore has been in DSS detention facility since August 3 when he was arrested in Lagos over the #ReveolutionNow protest. Justice Taiwo Taiwo, sitting at a federal high court in Abuja,  ordered the release of the activist but the order was disobeyed by DSS. Sowore has now been brought before the same court where he was arraigned on Monday on allegation of treason, money laundering and cyberbullying. One of the charges against Sowore was that he insulted the president. Adesina said: “It is too early for the president’s intervention. It is too early for Mr. Buhari to weigh in. It is an issue that is unraveling and I think it is still in the realm of security and judiciary. The DSS has a spokesman in Peter Afunanya. If you ask him this question, I’m sure he will be able to respond. “As we are now, I think it is premature for the presidency to weigh into this matter but when the presidency speaks, it should be the final position on this. “The president had been away. He came into the country yesterday. I have not been briefed. If he says this is our position on this matter, then I can speak on it. “Because I have not been briefed, I won’t be able to say much. But I am sure as a media house if you try to speak with the spokesman for the DSS, he may oblige.”
