The Reformed Niger Delta Avengers (RNDA) says it will blow up oilinstallations in Nigeria if President Muhammadu Buhari sacks theCoordinator of the Presidential Amnesty Programme (PAP), CharlesDokubo and replaces him with Dennis Otuaro, an aide to former NigerDelta militant leader, Government Ekpemupolo (Tompolo).In a statement by its spokesman, Johnmark Ezonebi, the group said,"After an emergency meeting at the Benin River, we took a standagainst the speculated gang up to remove the Amnesty coordinator andto be replaced with the Delta state deputy governor's younger brother,who is a stakeholder of PDP and allied to wanted militant warlord,Tompolo."It was the RNDA that made up nine militant groups in the creek thataccepted the federal government’s ceasefire agreement for peace andworked hard to the eventual emergence of Buhari as President, whilethe Tompolo's group mobilized and fight against the PresidentBuhari-led APC federal government from inception till date.“Mr. Dennis Otuoaro, who is also one of the three apostles of Tompolothat were fighting against president Muhammadu Buhari led APC federalgovernment cannot be appointed as the Special Adviser to the Presidenton Niger and the Presidential Amnesty coordinator.“RNDA want to make it clear that any attempt to remove or to replaceDokubo would lead to collateral damage on all oil facilities and oilinstallations. We will cripple all the major oil pipelines in thecreek of Niger Delta. Enough of this infighting, blackmail andoutright falsehoods against Prof. Charles Dokubo. A word is enough forthe wise."The militants added, “The RNDA will not fold its hand and watch thingsdeteriorate; as it has come to its notice the desperate moves by theMinister of State for Petroleum Resources, to hijack and hand over theAmnesty office to one of the allies of the former Moribund Niger DeltaAvengers (NDA) group."However, the Ijaw Peoples Development Initiative (IPDI) in a statementon Wednesday, by its acting spokesman, Timi Ogobiri, said Otuaro wasqualified to replace Dokubo."It's untrue to say that the anticipated appointment of Chief DennisOtuaro is compensation to former Niger Delta freedom fighter, highchief Government Ekpomupolo."But it's the level of Dennis commitment to Niger Delta question thatearns him this opportunity and there is nothing wrong been appointedas PAP Coordinator."
