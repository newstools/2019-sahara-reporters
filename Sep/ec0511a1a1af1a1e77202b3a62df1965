SaharaReporters Media A Chief Magistrates' Court sitting in Akure, the Ondo State capital, on Tuesday remanded a woman, who allegedly tortured her daughter to death, in prison custody. The woman, Elizabeth Akinola, had in August maltreated her four-year-old child named Testimony, leading to the death of the girl. Recalled that Testimony was rushed to the Ondo State Specialist Hospital lifeless and with bruises all over her body on the day the incident took place. While doctors at the hospital tried to revive the child, Akinola grabbed her lifeless body and disappeared from the facility. The woman was later arrested by the police in Ikare-Akoko after she was declared wanted. Akinola was arraigned on a two-count charge bordering on murder and physical assault of her daughter. Police prosecutor, Abdul-Lateef Sulaiman, told the court that he was filing a seven paragraph motion of notice on the murder case. He said the offence committed by the woman was punishable under section 357 of the criminal code cap 37 vol.1, Laws of the Ondo State of Nigeria 2006. He, however, prayed the court to remand the defendant in prison custody. But counsel to the defendant, Israel Balogun, argued against the application of the prosecutor asking for the remand of the woman in prison custody. However, in her ruling, Chief Magistrate Victoria Bob-Manuel ordered the remand of Akinola in prison custody pending the outcome of advice from the office of the Director of Public Prosecution. She adjourned the case until October 9, 2019.
