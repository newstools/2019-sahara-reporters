At least seven persons were killed in an explosion while travelling along Biu-Buratai-Buni Yadi-Damaturu road, a source told SaharaReporters. The explosion was suspected to have been caused by a landmine or an improvised explosive device (IED). This incident occurred between Kamuya and Buratai (hometown of the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai) at 10:30 am on Thursday.According to sources, the driver took off at Biu motor park in a GolfÂ  Volkswagen car and was heading for Maiduguri en route Buratai-Buni Yadi-Damaturu road as a result of constant attacks at Damboa road (a shorter but very risky route for motorists to ply)."Unfortunately, this Biu-Buni Yadi-Damaturu road is becoming a death trap for passengers. We lost all six passengers and a driver who left Biu to Maiduguri but stepped on a landmine after Buratai village before they entered Yobe State."Sadly, IEDs which planted on the bad parts of the road exploded and destroyed the vehicle with all seven occupants blown into pieces. "We are saddened by this ugly incident. We can't ply Damboa-Maiduguri highway due to Boko Haram attacks. Gradually Biu-Damaturu is getting out of hand," a road worker said.There was an ambush by terrorists along the road some weeks ago which claimed the life of a soldier.The latest killing came on the heels of the kidnapping and eventual release of six transportation personnel on the same route.
