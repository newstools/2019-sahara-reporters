The Benue State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) says there are about 256 dead teachers were on the payroll of the state. Mathew Mnyam, Chairman of the board, disclosed this to journalists in Makurdi on Friday. He said the government is carrying out a total clean-up of the system to rid it of ghost workers. “256 deceased still on payroll have been removed from the PVC. We have also removed others who retired and are still on payroll receiving a salary,” he said. The board chair mentioned that three directors were sent on compulsory leave so as to aid investigation into the issue. He added that one of the board staff in charge of payroll who was caught reinstating certain names on the payroll was suspended alongside another staff transferred out of the board for being unable to give an account of the assignment given to him. Mnyam stated that the board would soon clamp down on local governments executive secretaries performing below average just as he warned headmasters charging parents the various amount of money before enrolling their children to desist or face sanction because the board embarking on school enrolment drive would not view such acts lightly. “The board under my watch will soon clamp down on local government executive secretaries who are performing below expectations and any headmaster who is caught charging parents before enrolling their children will be shown his or her way out because public primary school are meant to be free. We will be doing strict monitoring,” the chairman warned.
