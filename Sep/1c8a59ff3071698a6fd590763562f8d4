Omoyele Sowore
SaharaReporters Media The Yoruba Solidarity Forum has urged the Nigerian Government to drop all charges against Omoyele Sowore and release him immediately. Publicity Secretary of YSF, Olajide Odumosu, who described the detention and trial of Sowore as a dangerous precedent and subversion of Nigeria’s judicial system, posited that the DSS did not act in line with the constitution. He also urged all Yoruba leaders to speak up against Sowore's prolonged detention, saying they should not leave the activist alone at this critical period of his travails. Odumosu said, “Nigerians are entitled to express their feelings. They should give him bail, he is entitled to temporary freedom. “What Sowore did through the botched protest was to express the feelings of Nigerians and in as much as the protest was peaceful and violent-free, there is no point putting him behind bar for that long period of time. “It is time for our leaders to learn to be accommodating. It is time for our political class to learn about the best way to handle varying views, especially, that of the opposition. “Democracy thrives when opposition's views are accommodated and handled maturely. “So, President Buhari must doff the robe of a former military man and put on an attire of a democrat. “We are not in a military regime where peoples' rights to freedom and other fundamental human rights were alien. “Nigeria is a democratic republic, therefore, unlawful detention of people can lead to further crisis and the government must try as much as possible to avoid this by listening to the cries of Nigerians.”
