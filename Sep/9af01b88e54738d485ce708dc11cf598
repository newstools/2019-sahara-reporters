For claiming to have hacked into the server of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) should be sorry and grateful for escaping being prosecuted, says Lai Mohammed. The presidential election petitions tribunal on Wednesday reaffirmed President Muhammadu Buhari's reelection, dismissing Atiku and PDP's petitions. However, Buhari's opponents said they would go as far as the Supreme Court of Nigeria to challenge the judgment. Mohammed, Nigeria's minister of information and culture and currently in Russia, said on Thursday that Atiku and the PDP should not have decided to take such a step. "Nigerians are tired of this orchestrated distraction, and will rather wish that the opposition, having lost at the polls and in court, will now join hands with the government to move Nigeria to the 'next level'," the Buhari minister said. Mohammed explained further: "This is more so that the judgment validating the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari was unanimous that the petition lacked merit, that the petitioners failed to prove any of the grounds upon which their case was anchored and that President Buhari is eminently qualified to contest the poll. "It is intriguing that a party that trumpets the rule of law at every turn will present, in open court, evidence it claimed to have obtained by hacking into a supposed INEC server. Donâ€™t they realize this is a criminal act for which they are liable? "Instead of threatening to head to the Supreme Court, driven more by ego than commonsense, they should be sorry for allowing desperation to overwhelm their sense of reasoning. Enough is enough! "We also thank Nigerians, who voted massively to re-elect President Buhari, for their continued support."
