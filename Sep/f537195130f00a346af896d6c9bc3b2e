The Sun Nigeria The Nigerian Ambassador to Burkina Faso, Ramatu Ahmed, says no fewerthan 10,000 Nigerian girls are forced into prostitution in BurkinaFaso.She disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria inOuagadougou on Monday.According to her, the victims are mainly underage girls kept inappalling conditions in Ouagadougou and mining camps across the WestAfrican country.Ahmed, who has been in Burkina Faso since August 2017, said over 200Nigerian girls were been repatriated this year.According to the Ambassador,  many of the girls, who were promisedjobs in the country and Europe by the human traffickers, are notwilling to return home.“The spate of human trafficking here in Burkina Faso is a big concernto the embassy because, at present, we have nothing less than 10,00Nigerian girls who have been trafficked into Burkina Faso ascommercial sex workers.“And most of these girls are underage; most left schools and areroaming about doing commercial sex work in Burkina Faso.“This apart from being a dent to our country is also a sort of concernas far as their health is concerned. This is very serious to us andmost of the girls who want to go back, as a result, this voluntaryrepatriation do it because they were tricked, they did not know thecondition they are going to found themselves here.“For every Nigerian girl that escapes and wants to go back, there aremore than 10 in the bush that are willing to carry on,” she saidAhmed condemned the activities of Nigerian syndicates operating inBurkina Faso, vowing that the embassy will continue to track them downand bring the perpetrators to book in collaboration with the localauthorities.She said the embassy was partnering with the InternationalOrganisation for Migration office in Ouagadougou to assist in thevoluntary repatriation of some of the victims of human trafficking.“Two hundred girls have been repatriated to Nigeria by the embassy,this is apart from the ones that run to the churches, some to otherCivil society Organisations and the International Organisations onMigration.In fact, the IOM is complaining to the embassy that most of its moneymeant for West Africa is used to repatriate Nigerian girls back homeand they are complaining that with time, they would not be able tocope with the number.“So, if the embassy alone has repatriated 200 girls, you can imaginehow many girls the IOM has repatriated and the reason they arecomplaining,” she said.Ahmed appealed: “I am pleading with Nigerian parents that they shouldknow what their children are doing.”
