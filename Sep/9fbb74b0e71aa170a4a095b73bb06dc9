The National Chairman of the Alliance for New Nigeria (ANN), EmmanuelDania, has asked the South African government to do more than justapologizing to countries affected by the recent xenophobic attacks.Dania, in an interview with ChannelsTV, faulted the apology made bythe country’s special envoy, Mr. Jeff Radebe, on behalf of PresidentCyril Ramaphosa when he visited Nigeria.“I think the South African government needs to do more. This is notthe first time that we have seen this xenophobic attack. Thegovernment hasn’t done anything in the past, the reason why this ishappening again.“So I think there has to be pressure on the Nigerian government toensure that the South African government does beyond just giving anapology,” he said.Speaking further, he said, “Our lives are lost and they must be ableto guarantee the lives of Nigerians. Every life of Nigerians in SouthAfrica matters and they must be able to give adequate security to thecitizens."
