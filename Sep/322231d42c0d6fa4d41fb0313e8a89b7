Due to the closure of Nigeria’s borders with Benin Republic, rice smugglers are seeking out more devious ways of importing the product into the country. National Coordinator of the Institute of Chartered Economists of Nigeria, Dr Oladapo Ganiyu, while speaking with SaharaReporters said that people have resulted to fitting bags of rice into tyres of automobiles. Ganiyu, who claims this method is carcinogenic, said the border closure was untimely. He said, “The closure of the border now is untimely. People are now packing rice inside tyres. “When the four tyres are rolling, will you suspect there is rice there? The way they are bringing it in, it can cause cancer. “The people I have spoken with on commercial buses and market women, say the rice is not sweet and it takes time to cook.” Speaking further, Ganiyu said ICEN will give the government’s new economic team six months before judging their performance. For over 30 days, Nigeria’s border with Benin Republic and parts of its Northern border with Niger Republic had been closed. Comptroller-General of Customs, Hameed Ali, insists that the border closure will not cease until concerned West African states stop the smuggling of parboiled rice from their country into Nigeria.
