President Muhammadu Buhari will be leaving Nigeria to attend the 74th United Nations General Assembly in New York today. President Buhari is scheduled as the fifth speaker on the first day of the debates – another plus for the country as most world leaders will be listening in the General Assembly Hall while the global audience watches on live television. President Buhari will meet with a select group of top America-based Nigerian businessmen and potential investors, according to Femi Adesina, Special Adviser, Media and Publicity. He also said, “The President is expected to underscore his administration’s commitment to build on the achievements of its three-point agenda following the renewal of his electoral mandate by majority of Nigerians. "He will also reaffirm Nigeria’s position on salient global issues. “In addition to high-level meetings, the Nigerian delegation is expected to participate at events organised by the country’s Ministries, Departments and Agencies. “Buhari is also billed to hold bilateral meetings with some leaders of other delegations; chief executive officers of big companies keen to invest in the country; Aliko Dangote and Bill Gates on sustaining the polio-free campaign as well as issues on human capital projects and development.”
