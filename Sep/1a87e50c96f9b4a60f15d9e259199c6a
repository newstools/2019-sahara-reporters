  Williams Oyibogare, an operative of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has allegedly committed suicide. According to a report by PUNCH, two empty bottles of Sniper insecticide was found in Oyibogare's home, hence the suspicion that the operative must have taken his own life. The Edo State Police Command said that an investigation is ongoing to unravel the cause of his death, stating that autopsy would reveal the fact. Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Chidi Nwabuzor, said, “Investigations are ongoing and it would be too soon to make any conclusions at this stage; it is too early to make any pronouncements. "Of course, there will be an autopsy to know the cause of the death and inquire about what happened.” A colleague of the deceased said Oyibogare recently returned from his annual leave looking emaciated. He said, “Oyibogare returned from leave recently looking pale. "He may have died from an illness or it could also have been suicide but we cannot say for sure since we don’t live with him."
