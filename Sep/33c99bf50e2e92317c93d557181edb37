Following latest xenophobic attacks on Nigerians and other African migrants in South Africa and reprisals on South African businesses in Nigeria, the Action Democratic Party has said that the two countries cannot afford to endure a strained relationship. ADP posited that Nigeria and South Africa must unite to avoid crisis and further cruel acts against their citizens. The party in a statement by its Lagos State Publicity Secretary, Prince Adelaja Adeoye, called on President Muhammadu Buhari to take a tough stand on the matter and ensure that it does not occur again. The ADP said, “Africa must unite, close ranks and avoid any internal crisis that is capable of setting them against one another. “Africans should be their brothers keepers and not be wild, crude and show barbaric attitude towards one another. “We call on President of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa, to immediately put machinery in place to secure the lives and properties of Nigerians in his country as both Nigeria and South Africa cannot afford or endure a strained relationship.”
