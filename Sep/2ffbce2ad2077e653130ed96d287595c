Soon after the Department of State Services secured a court order todetain the convener of #RevolutionNow protest, Omoyele Sowore, for 45days, his lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), vowed to challenge the orderand ensure that the activist regain his freedom soon.But 32 out of the 45 detention days are gone, Falana is stillstruggling to get a hearing date in court for the application he filedto challenge Sowore’s detention. After granting the DSS the 45-daydetention order on August 8, Justice Taiwo Taiwo adjourned the casetill September 21.By the time Falana came up with his application on behalf of Sowore,Justice Taiwo had concluded a round of his sitting as a vacation judgeand proceeded on recess. In the circumstance, Falana took theapplication before Justice Nkeonye Maha, who had taken over as thenext vacation judge.But in Justice Maha’s court, Falana met a brick wall as the judgedeclined to hear Sowore’s application on the grounds that she couldnot review the order of Justice Taiwo, who is a judge of coordinatejurisdiction. Justice Maha directed Falana to take the applicationback to Justice Taiwo, particularly as Justice Taiwo had earlieradjourned the case till September 21. By September 21, Sowore wouldhave spent 44 days in the DSS detention.In an interview with our correspondent, Falana describes thedevelopment as unfortunate but says he is not giving up the fight forSowore’s release.The human rights lawyer says, “It is unfortunate that our client hasnearly completed the 45-day detention period.“Mr. Sowore perfectly understands the issues involved in his currenttravails. He is even lucky that he is being detained for 45 days. I ampursuing the case of scores of people languishing in the custody ofthe Nigerian Navy for close to two years without trial.  All the same,we are pursuing the application to quash the 45-day detention orderslammed on Mr. Sowore by the Federal High Court.”On how he intends to proceed after the setback in Justice Maha’scourt, Falana says, “Since the file was rejected by Justice Maha, wehave already returned to Justice Taiwo’s court. My colleagues in Abujahave applied for a hearing date. I am reasonably sure that the casewill soon be heard.”Falana believes there is no more to the difficulty he is having ingetting the court to hear Sowore’s application than the fact that thecourt is on vacation. He likes to rule out external influences.He says, “The Federal High Court is on annual vacation. Hence, thedelay in having the matter heard expeditiously. No external influenceis involved in the matter whatsoever.“We have, however, taken up the issue of the delay with the relevantauthorities because the law provides that the writ of habeas corpus,fundamental rights applications and other cases pertaining to thepersonal liberty of any citizen must be heard and determinedexpeditiously.”But if Falana gets Justice Taiwo to hear the application today, hewould have only crossed the first hurdle. Before him is the secondhurdle of convincing the judge to reverse the 45-day detention order,after which he will likely face the third hurdle of persuading thejudge not to, in fact, extend the detention period, should the DSSfile for such a request.Falana, more than anyone, understands that these days, it is easier toget into the DSS detention than to get out. He is the lawyer to theleader of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria, Sheik Ibraheem El-Zakzaky,who has already spent four years in the DSS detention and he is stillcounting. Not even a court order could force El-Zakzaky out of theDSS’ iron grips. With his experience in El-Zakzaky’s case, Falana maybe in for a lot of déjà vu feelings in his quest to get Sowore out ofDSS detention.Incidentally, it was nine days after Sowore was taken into custodythat El-Zakzaky was temporarily let out by the DSS for a medical tripto India in early August.Sowore was arrested in the wee hours of August 3, 2019, two days tohis planned nationwide #RevolutionNow protest.The Federal Government believes that having tagged the protest‘#RevolutionNow’, Sowore had made his mission to topple the Buharigovernment through violence abundantly clear.The government believes that having contested and lost in the February23 presidential election, which Buhari won, Sowore was planning toachieve his presidential ambition through his planned #RevolutionNowprotest.The DSS said intelligence at its disposal showed that Sowore had ameeting in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, with some foreigncollaborators, who mobilized with “millions of dollars” to toppleBuhari’s government through violent protests.The Sahara Reporters publisher, according to the DSS, was also incommunication with the fugitive leader of the proscribed IndigenousPeople of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu – another DSS customer, who was chargedwith treasonable felony and spent months in the DSS custody beforefleeing the country.Despite being a public figure in Nigeria, Sowore has managed to keephis family life private.When the footage surfaced online last week of his wife, Opeyemi,speaking on an American TV programme, Democracy Now, one gets thefeeling that with such a beautiful wife, why was Sowore organizing his#RevolutionNow protest against the Buhari government, knowing the DSScould arrest him and deny him, for a long time, the warm company ofhis wife and two children, nine and 12, living in America.On the programme, Opeyemi recounted how before DSS operatives seizedSowore’s phone in the night of August 3, he managed to send her a textmessage, “I love you,” to which she said, “Okay, I love you too,” onlyto be told later that he had been arrested.She believes the Nigerian Federal Government has no basis to keep herhusband in detention.Asked if Opeyemi was right, Falana says, “I cannot comment on thatstatement since the matter is sub judice. In fact, that is one of thegrounds of our objection to the 45-day detention period.”Falana says he has access to Sowore and that his client is in highspirits in the DSS detention.The lawyer says, “His spirits are very high but he is virtuallyredundant as the investigation has been concluded.“He is, however, worried over the black-on-black violence going on inSouth Africa. He said but for his incarceration, he would havetravelled to South Africa to interview President Cyril Ramphosa andother top government officials who have been inciting unemployed SouthAfrican youths to unleash xenophobic attacks on hapless Africanimmigrants.”(Culled from Punch)
