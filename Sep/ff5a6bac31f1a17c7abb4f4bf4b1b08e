Governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi, has sent a delegation to visit the families of slain students of Federal University of Oye-Ekiti, Ekiti State. Two undergraduates of the institution, Okonofua Joseph and Dada Kehinde, were killed during a peaceful protest of students expressing their frustration at the lack of power supply on campus. The students had blocked the convoy of the First Lady of the state, Bisi Fayemi, while she was on a tour before police officers attached to her opened fire on them, resulting in the deaths of the two students and injury of several others. The Ekiti State Government in a tweet on Friday said that the visit was ordered by Governor Fayemi to commiserate with the families of the victims. The tweet reads, “Ekiti State Government commiserates with the families of Joseph Okunofua and Kehinde Dada, students of the Federal University, Oye Ekiti, who lost their lives during Tuesday’s protest in Oye-Ekiti. “The delegation led by Hon. Oyebanji visited Mrs Esther Okunofua, mother of Joseph, who was a 300level student of Biology Education in Ido-Ekiti and Mr and Mrs Adedayo Dada, parents of Kehinde Dada in Usi Ekiti.”
