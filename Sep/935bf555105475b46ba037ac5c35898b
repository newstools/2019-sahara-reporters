Members of Coalition of Civil Society Groups have given the British Government 21 days ultimatum to reverse the $9.6bn judgment awarded against the Nigerian Government or risk mass action. President of the group, Bassey Williams, disclosed this on Tuesday at the British Embassy in Abuja while addressing protesters for a second day. Williams said the ultimatum was imperative to enable the United Kingdom authorities to put their acts together and allow their court to resume from vacation. He noted that after the expiration of the ultimatum, the protesters would be left with no option than to shut down the facility and occupy it. He said, “We are giving the British Government a 21-day ultimatum for them to reverse the judgment and call the British judge to order, to call the P&ID to order and help Nigeria. “We are begging the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, to help Nigeria. “After 21 days if nothing happens, we will come back to occupy British Embassy and this time around we are not going home.”
