NigeriNigerian film, ‘Daughters of Chibok’, has won the prestigious Venice Film Festival in Italy. Saharareporters had earlier reported on August 7, 2019 that ‘Daughters Of Chibok’ was the only VR film from Africa to have its world premiere at the prestigious festival in Italy. The film, which addresses the impact of the kidnapped Chibok girls on their surviving family members, also aims to remind the global community on the need to rescue the remaining 112 schoolgirls still in Boko Haram captivity. The film jointly produced by Northeast Humanitarian Innovation Hub and the VR360 Stories, depicted a particular mother, who frequently washes the clothes of her abducted daughter in readiness for her return. The award was presented to Joel Benson, the Nigerian producer of the film during the festival in Italy on Saturday night. Speaking on the award, Benson said, “I dedicate this award to the woman in the story, Yana, who shared her story with me. “Because of this award, the world will hear of Chibok and remember the girls still in captivity.”
