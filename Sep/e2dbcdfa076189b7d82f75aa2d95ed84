An attempt to abduct former Director-General of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, Dr Paul Orhii, has been foiled by men of the Nigeria Police Force. The incident occurred in the early hours of Monday morning in his Makurdi, Benue State, home. Orhii, who narrated the incident on his Facebook page, stated that it took the efforts of police personnel around to ward off the bandits that sneaked into his home at about 1:00am. He said, “Early this morning, at precisely 1:05 am, four boys armed with pistols and machetes sneaked into my Makurdi home and went straight to the security post in an attempt to disarm my security personnel. “During the ensuing struggle, the gallant police officers started shooting, which caused the intruders to run for safety, leaving behind two machetes and a pistol cartridge loaded with six bullets. “Preliminary investigations indicate that one of my security guards may have been involved as their inside man. “He and all the items recovered have been handed over to the police in Makurdi to assist them in their investigation.”
