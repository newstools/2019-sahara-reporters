An envoy sent by South Africa’s President, Cyril Ramaphosa, to hold talks with President Muhammadu Buhari in the wake of the latest xenophobic attacks on Nigerians in the former apartheid nation, has said told President of that country that Buhari was pleased with the way South Africa dealt with the problem. President Ramaphosa said this during his address to a special joint sitting of parliament, according to a report by SABC. He said, “I spoke with former minister, Jeff Radebe, who told me he was well received by the President of Nigeria, Muhammed Buhari, who expressed a great respect for the effort we are taking to deal with this matter. “But he also confirmed that he will be coming for a state visit in our country not withstanding what has happened and I really appreciated that.” Ramaphosa said there was a need to create laws that will regulate how foreign nationals operate their businesses in South Africa, adding that such would help in preventing conflict with locals. He added, “We should consider as many countries have, the regulations that will regulate how people from other nations can operate businesses, how they can participate in businesses within the small and medium enterprises.”
