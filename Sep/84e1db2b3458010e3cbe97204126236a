Cameroon international and one of football’s greatest stars, Samuel Eto’o, has announced his retirement from the game. The former Barcelona, Chelsea and Real Madrid striker takes a majestic bow from the game after 22 illustrious years on the soccer pitch. The 38-year-old’s last club was Qatar Star League side Qatar SC, which he joined in the summer of 2018 from Turkey’s Konyaspor. Eto’o made the announcement in a post on his Instagram page with the caption, “The End. Towards a new challenge. Thank you all, big love.” The Cameroonian joined Real Madrid as a youth player in 1997 and went on to spend the next three years with the Spanish side. He moved on to RCD Mallorca after failing to break into the first team at Madrid. But it was at Barcelona where he joined from Mallorca that Eto’o became a household name to many football fans across the globe. In the later years of his career, the 38-year-old also featured for Inter Milan, Anzhi Makhachkala, Chelsea, Everton, Sampdoria, Antalyaspor and Konyaspor both in Turkey before quitting the game. Eto’o would be remembered for his goal-poaching prowess and energetic displays on the soccer pitch by many football lovers around the world.
