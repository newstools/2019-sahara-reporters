The Senior Pastor and Founder of the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly(COZA), Biodun Fatoyinbo, says he has no business interfacing withBusola Dakolo in the law court over the allegation of rape levelledagainst him because the lawsuit was "filed out of time".Busola, wife of Nigerian singer Timi Dakolo had sued Fatoyinbo forraping her when she was a teenager.The COZA pastor denied the allegation.An FCT high court in a writ of summons obtained on September 9 by theNews Agency of Nigeria dated September 6 and served on Fatoyinbo,ordered the pastor to appear before it within 14 days of the serviceor judgment may be given in his absence.But Fatoyinbo through his lawyer Alex Izinyon in a preliminaryobjection dated September 20, said the case was filed out of time.“The claimant’s suit is statute-barred therefore this honourable courtlacks the jurisdiction to entertain same; the suit is frivolous andpalpable abuse of court process.“The suit has no cause of action for this Honourable Court toadjudicate upon; the reliefs sought in this instant suit cannot begranted, therefore this suit is incompetent,” Fatoyinbo said.He, therefore, demanded to be awarded the cost of N50 million jointlyand severally against Busola and her solicitor, while requesting thecourt dismiss the suit for abuse of judicial process.Meanwhile, Pelumi Olajengbesi, lead counsel to Dakolo, when contactedto react on the preliminary objection filed by Fatoyinbo, declined tocomment on the matter.On the other hand, Busola Dakolo is seeking the order of the court tocompel Fatoyinbo to publish a clearly worded apology to her on thefront page of at least two (2) National Newspapers and two NationalTelevisions for seven days running consecutively.She had two months ago made a shocking revelation in a detailedinterview with Chude Jideonwo, a lawyer and journalist of how theAbuja-based cleric raped her as a teenager.She claimed that Fatoyinbo had sexual intercourse with her onSeptember 23 and 26, 2002 caused her continuous emotional distress andamount to intentional infliction of emotional distress.The viral video report had set social media and other online platformson fire, evoking shock, backlash and criticisms from Nigerians,especially the Christian community.Pastor Fatoyinbo was detained during interrogation over the rapeallegation at the Force Headquarters in Abuja in August but was laterreleased on bail.Fatoyinbo had also boycotted the panel set up by the PentecostalFellowship of Nigeria (PFN) to investigate the rape allegation againsthim, claiming that he was advised by his lawyers not to appear.
