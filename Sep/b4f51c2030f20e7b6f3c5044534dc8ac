Botswana, Zambia and Lesotho have issued a warning to citizens travelling to South Africa over the recent xenophobic attacks in the country. The countries expressed displeasure at the killing of foreign nationals in South Africa and warned their citizens to exercise extreme caution when visiting some cities in that country especially Pretoria and Johannesburg. Botswana’s Ministry of International Affairs and Cooperation on Wednesday said all citizens travelling to South Africa must “exercise extreme caution because of the violent unrests in multiple locations there”. The ministry informed its citizens to stay away from scenes of the unrests in Pretoria's Central Business District, Johannesburg's CBD, Hillbrow area and its southern suburbs of Jeppestown and Malvern, among other places. Zambia told its citizen to stay away from South Africa until the security situation in the country improves while its Transport Ministry warned lorry drivers to "avoid travelling to South Africa until the security situation improves". Zambia’s football association has also cancelled a friendly match it was to play with South Africa on Saturday in response to the xenophobic attacks in the former apartheid nation.
