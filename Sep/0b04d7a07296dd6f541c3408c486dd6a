A housewife, Talatu, 35, on Monday approached a Sharia Court ll sitting in Magajin Gari, Kaduna State for a divorce with her husband, Nasiru Sulaiman, for being sex-starved by him for five years. She said, “We have six children but he has refused to enrol them in school. “I enrolled them but he pulled them out, saying that I want to change their belief from his school of thought. “For nine months now they have not been to school. “The house we live in is dilapidated. It is infested by rats. He gives me only N300 to feed his seven children. “Sometimes I go out to do menial jobs to assist the family but he accuses me of prostitution. “I can’t continue living with him. I want a divorce.” But denying the allegations against him by his wife, Sulaiman said, “When I left my wife for a while, she was pregnant at the time. “But when I came back, she told me that she had an abortion because she does not want to bear any more children.” Speaking further, Sulaiman admitted that he gives Talatu N300 daily because there are food items in the house. The judge, Murtala Nasir, ordered both parties to settle amicably and adjourned the case until September 23 for hearing, according to the News Agency of Nigeria.
