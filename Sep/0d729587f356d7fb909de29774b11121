Deputy Gov.Simon Achuba and Gov. Yahaya Bello Deputy Governor of Kogi State, Simon Achuba, has dragged his boss, Governor Yahaya Bello, to court over the non-payment of his allowances. Achuba took Bello before a National Industrial Court of Nigeria on Monday, according to the News Agency of Nigeria. The suit with number NICN/ABJ/244/2019 filed on August 19, prayed the court to declare that the decision of the defendant to withhold his allowances was discriminatory and amounted to unfair labour practice. He is also seeking for an order of the court for the payment of N921.5m being his travel allowances, monthly impress, security votes and other statutory allocations due to his office. The case, which was filed by Falana and Falana Chamber, is yet to be assigned to a judge. The rift between Achuba and Bello became public in October 2018 following reports of an alleged strained relationship between them. In February, Achuba said his life was under threat following the withdrawal of his security details allegedly on the orders of the governor. In August, the stateâ€™s House of Assembly commenced impeachment process against Achuba.
