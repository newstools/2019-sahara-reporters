The Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Yola, Adamawa State, has sacked Shuaibu Langaga of the All Progressives Congress for certificate forgery. Langaga had his election as member representing Mubi North in the Adamawa State Assembly nullified on Monday because he forged a first school leaving certificate, according to the panel. The tribunal subsequently ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission to issue certificate of return to Suleiman Vokna of the Peoples Democratic Party. Langaga however, said he will appeal the judgment.
