Chris Ngige, the Minister of Labour and Employment, says he waswelcomed by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) when he visited theUnited States of America recently.Ngige said he fed and protected the group when he was the governor ofAnambra State.The former governor also urged the Igbo, one of the dominant ethnicgroups in Nigeria, to stop claiming they are being marginalized.The minister, an Igbo, advised his kinsmen to participate during theelectoral process.Ngige, speaking in Obosi, Anambra State, on Tuesday said: “The Igboshould stop shouting marginalization. They should stand up and assertthemselves to be counted. Nigeria belongs to all of us.“Equity favours the Igbo to produce the next president of the country,but they must work hard and position themselves for it.“We should stop political sentiments. Politicians don’t give powerbased on sentiment and emotion. President Muhammadu Buhari has said heis favourable to an Igbo president.“We must support him and associate with the APC. Nobody will give youthe president of Nigeria in your bedroom.”He also spoke about IPOB.Members of the proscribed secessionist group have threatened to attackany Nigerian leader perceived to be corrupt when they go overseas.Ngige said, “IPOB was registered by the late President-General ofOhaneze Ndigbo, Dr. Dozie Ikedife, and other Igbo as a non-violentgroup."What is going on now in the group is not part of the work plan. Ivisited the United States of America recently, and I was welcomed byIPOB members.“They knew I fed and protected them when I was in office as governor.I have said it several times that Biafra cannot be achieved the IPOBway."
