Israeli televangelist, Benny Hinn, has said that he is quitting prosperity preaching because the Holy Spirit was fed up with it. The 66-year-old, who made the announcement during a Facebook live programme earlier in the week, pointed that such preaching was a gimmick adopted by Christian religious leaders to squeeze money out from members of their congregation. In Nigeria, where prosperity preaching is popular with many Christian leaders, Hinn’s latest position would come as a terrible blow and in fact a bruising swipe at their ‘money for blessing’ scheme. Hinn said, “I’m sorry to say that prosperity has gone a little crazy and I’m correcting my own theology and you need to all know it. “Because when I read the Bible now, I don’t see the Bible with the same eyes I saw it 20 years ago. “I think it’s an offense to the Lord, it’s an offense to say give $1,000. I think it’s an offense to the Holy Spirit to place a price on the Gospel. I’m done with it. “I will never again ask you to give $1,000 or whatever amount, because I think the Holy Ghost is just fed up with it. “I think it hurts the Gospel. When they invite me to telethons, I think they will not like me anymore. “If I hear one more time, break the back of debt with $1,000, I’m gonna rebuke them. I think that’s buying the Gospel. That’s buying the blessing. That’s grieving the Holy Spirit. “If you are not giving because you love Jesus, don’t bother giving. I think giving has become such a gimmick; it’s making me sick to my stomach.”
