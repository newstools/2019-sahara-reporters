Quartz The Zimbabwean government plans a state funeral for longtime rulerRobert Mugabe in a sports stadium in Harare next Saturday, with aburial ceremony a day later, it said in a memo sent to embassies onSunday.Zimbabweans have been confused about when they would get to pay theirlast respects to Mugabe since his death in a Singapore hospital onFriday after a long illness.Mugabe had dominated Zimbabwean politics for almost four decades fromindependence in 1980 until he was removed by his own army in aNovember 2017 coup.Revered by many as a liberator who freed his people from whiteminority rule, Mugabe was vilified by others for wrecking one ofAfrica’s most promising economies and ruthlessly crushing hisopponents.President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who worked closely with Mugabe fordecades before helping to oust him, granted Mugabe the status of anational hero within hours of his death.The memo sent by Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs to embassiesin Harare and seen by Reuters said the funeral would be in theNational Sports Stadium but did not specify where the burial would be.It said heads of state would be expected to leave the stadiumimmediately after the funeral ceremony because officials would be busywith preparations for the burial.The Zimbabwe Independent newspaper reported last month that Mugabedidn’t want to be buried at National Heroes Acre – a site reserved forthe country’s heroes – because he felt bitter about the way he wasremoved from power, Reuters report.
