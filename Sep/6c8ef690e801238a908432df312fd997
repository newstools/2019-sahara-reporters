Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF), Dr. Kayode Fayemi andthe Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related OffencesCommission (ICPC) have differed on security votes for state governors.While Fayemi claimed that security votes for state governors werelegal, the ICPC Chairman, Prof. Bolaji Owasanoye, said the monies forgovernors and other agencies were easy means of stealing public funds.Owasanoye stated this on Wednesday at a one-day policy dialogue onaccountability for security votes organised by the Anti-CorruptionAcademy of Nigeria (ACAN).He said security votes for governors and government agencies was anavenue for abuse of public trust, escalation of poverty,underdevelopment, and insecurity, insisting that appropriation forsecurity votes has increased rather than reduced insecurity.“Money that should be available for social and economic development isappropriated as security votes and used with the discretion ofgovernors,” the ICPC boss said.However, Fayemi said: “There is no place in the world where securityexpenditures are subjected to public debate, for obvious reasons.“I hope this meeting will come up with international best practice onhow security votes should be managed, but not on whether we shouldhave security votes because I don’t see the use of dealing with that.“There is a widespread belief that the appropriation of security votesin Nigeria is unconstitutional and illegal. This is not correct.”
