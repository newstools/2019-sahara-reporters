Winston Osuchukwu, Co-founder and Managing Partner at Trans-SaharaInvestment (TSIC), has raised the alarm over the growth rate of theEthiopian economy and how that might adversely affect Nigeria.Speaking in an interview with CNBC Africa, Osuchukwu said foreigninvestors would prefer to go to Ethiopia or other African countriesand not Nigeria because of the difficulty of doing business in thecountry.The Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) recently saidNigeria ranked 146 out of 190 countries on the Ease of Doing Businessglobally.Osuchukwu said the lack of a favourable business environment inNigeria would push investors, whose choice who have hitherto beNigeria, to other African countries.He also raised concern over the Africa free trade agreement whichencourages an open border across African countries.He said: “Free trade could also mean I don’t have to come to Nigeriato do business with Nigeria. I can do business with Nigeria by proxy.It (Africa Free Trade Agreement) is significant because of howdifficult it is to do business in Nigeria, you will find that some ofthe investment that should have come into Nigeria can now go intoneighbouring countries and those countries can serve Nigeria.“The second one is, the rise of Ethiopia is actually a significantrisk to Nigeria. Nigeria used to be the centre of gravity for allsub-Saharan Africa. We are the largest economy; we are the largestmarket out there.“Ethiopia has opened up its economy. Ethiopia is a much morecompelling economy to go to. Only good news has come out of there interms of how they are opening up their economy. They have betterinfrastructures in place.”
