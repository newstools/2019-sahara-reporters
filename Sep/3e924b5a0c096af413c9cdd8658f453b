  A report has emerged implicating Italy’s trained and armed Libyancoastguards of recording Nigerian and other countries' migrants theyrescued off the Mediterranean as missing.The Guardian reports that the migrants intercepted by the Libyancoastguard are returned to so-called detention centres where,according to aid groups and the testimonies of asylum seekers who wereheld in Zawiya detention camp, they suffer unspeakable violence, rape,and torture.One of the migrants said in a testimony that they were fed with hardbread and seawater, raped and tortured while waiting for theirrelatives to ransom them.“All the women who were with us, once housed inside the shed, weresystematically and repeatedly raped,” a testimony seen by the Guardianstated.“We were locked up and they gave us hard bread and seawater to drink.”One of the migrants among a set of refugees held since July 2018,claimed to have seentwo people get killed for attempting to escape.“They gave us a phone to contact our relatives so we could instructthem how to pay for our release,” the migrant said. “During myimprisonment, I saw two migrants shot dead because they tried toescape.”The evidence is only just pouring out, following the arrest of aGuinean and two Egyptians in the Italian coastal town of Sicily.The United Nations had in a report released last week corroborated thefindings made by the prosecutors in the Sicilian precinct of Agrigentosaying, “Hundreds of rescued migrants who were reported to have beensent to detention centres were later listed as missing, and it isbelieved they may have been trafficked or sold to smugglers, whileothers have disappeared.”The Nigerian government has been very coy on providing detail aboutstatistics on the possibility of Nigerians being among these refugees.The ministry of foreign affairs had told the BBC that nine Nigerianswere killed in an airstrike on a detention camp in Libya on July 4,2019.Last week, the United Nations reached a deal to evacuate about 4,700refugees from Libya to Rwanda and the number of Nigerians among thesemigrants are not known.
