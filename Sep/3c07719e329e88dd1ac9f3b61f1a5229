  The Take It Back Movement has condemned the attack on Nigerians and other African migrants in South Africa. The group called for a partnership between Nigeria and South African authorities to end the killings. Blaming the South African Government and security agencies for not doing enough to curb the killing of Nigerians and destruction of their investments, also said that the Nigerian Government must be held accountable for the situation. The movement, in a statement by its Director of Media and Communications, Rachel Onamusi-Kpiasi, said the situation was totally unacceptable. The statement reads, “The Take It Back Movement has watched with growing concern as the lives, livelihoods, and property of Nigerians in South Africa have, once again, become targets of violent, xenophobic attacks. “The South African Government and security agents have stood in silent complicity with these atrocities, and in some cases, facilitated it. “The Nigerian Government must take a lot of the blame, as, if Nigeria had been restored to its place of pride as the giant of Africa, less Nigerians would feel the need to seek sustenance elsewhere.”
