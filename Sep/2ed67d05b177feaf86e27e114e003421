Hong Kong police fired tear gas and nonlethal bullets atanti-government protesters on Sunday evening as demonstrationsescalated across the city following a peaceful march to the USconsulate that drew thousands of residents.Nonlethal shots were fired at protesters without warning after around100 gathered at Mong Kok police station in the area of Kowloon,chanting that police were “gangsters.”Riot police soon appeared on the scene as protesters melted into side streets.Protesters have gathered near the police building every night for thepast week, leaving funeral offerings at an adjacent subway stationentrance where residents widely believe someone was killed when policecleared the station at a demonstration last week.On Sunday, many continued to burn paper money and light candle sandincense even as protesters built barricades nearby and police warnedprotesters via loudspeaker to stand down.Earlier rounds of tear gas were fired off in Causeway Bay, a shoppingdistrict across the harbour on Hong Kong Island, where protesters hadgathered by the thousands following the U.S. consulate march.As they walked, many built barricades and lit trash cans on fire in abid to slow down police.Most, however, had left by the time riot police arrived, leaving themto gas mostly journalists and bystanders who shouted at officers.Several arrests were also made as dozens of officers surrounded smallgroups of suspected protesters.Riot police were stationed across the city for most of Sundayincluding subway stations near where demonstrations were expected tooccur, cutting off avenues of escape for protesters who were forced tochange clothes and leave on foot in a bid to avoid arrest.Earlier on Sunday, tens of thousands of Hong Kong residents marched tothe U.S. consulate in the afternoon as part of a police-approved marchto deliver a petition asking the U.S. Congress to sign a billcontaining punitive measures for officials found to have suppressed“basic freedoms”.“We hope the U.S. government can pass the act so Hong Kong’s autonomycan be maintained.“I think the ultimate goal is to let Hong Kong be Hong Kong,” saidWendy, an accountant taking part in the protest.Protesters carried U.S. flags and signs in English like “ResistBeijing, liberate Hong Kong” and “Sanctions against those [who]trample freedom, justice and humanity” as they marched through thehilly streets of central Hong Kong island.Many chanted slogans like “Five demands, not one less” and held uptheir hands displaying five fingers in a call for leader Carrie Lam tomeet all of their demands.Others sang the U.S. national anthem as they marched below thesprawling diplomatic complex under the watchful eye of scores of riotpolice stationed along the way, drawing the ire of many protesters whoshouted that they were “gangsters” in Cantonese.Lam formally withdrew an extradition bill earlier this week that wasthe trigger for the start of the protests three months ago, but themove has failed to quell the demonstrations.The bill would have amended Hong Kong law to allow residents to beextradited to mainland China.Since protests began on June 9, they have escalated into a massanti-government demonstration with demands including calls forelectoral reform.Protesters have said they will continue to demonstrate until all oftheir demands are met.The focus of Sunday’s rally was the handing over of a petition callingfor U.S. legislators to sign off on the Hong Kong Human Rights andDemocracy Act.The act – due to be debated at committee level in Congress – wouldallow the U.S. the revoke the visa or freeze assets of Hong Kongresidents who were found to have harmed human rights in thesemi-autonomous Chinese city.Protester Steve Nip said many in Hong Kong felt there was no one elseto hold the city’s leadership accountable as they are rubber-stampedby Beijing.He and others were also angry that Lam has failed to set up anindependent commission reviewing police violence during the protests.Lam has instead said actions will be reviewed by an existing police committee.Nip said police had behaved in an “inhumane” manner when they arrestedprotesters but were now accountable to no one.Hong Kong is a former British colony that returned to Chinesesovereignty in 1997.It was promised special rights and privileges until 2047 under the“one country, two systems” agreement, dpa and NAN report.
