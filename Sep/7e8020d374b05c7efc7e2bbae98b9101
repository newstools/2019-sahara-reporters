President Muhammadu Buhari has now arrived in New York for the 74th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). Buhari departed Abuja on Sunday for the event that was opened on September 16 and would be on until September 24. According to Geoffery Onyeama, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the president, who would be the fifth leader to address the assembly, would use the opportunity to articulate the priorities of the Nigerian government to the world. He said Nigeria was hoping to partake in engagements that will help the country have seats in several organisations such as the International Maritime Organisation, the World Heritage Committee, and the International Civil Aviation Council. Nigeria will also be pushing for the UN’s support in the war on terror, the humane treatment of migrants, as well as Nigeria’s quest to recharge lake Chad.
