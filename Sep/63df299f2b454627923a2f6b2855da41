Nembe Creek Trunk Line, one of the two pipelines exporting Nigeria’s best oil grade, Bonny Light, has been placed under force majeure for the second time in about five months. Reuters reports that a spokesperson for Iteo – an indigenous petroleum exploration and production company, revealed this on Tuesday. According to the official, the pipeline which conveys between 100,000 and 150,000 barrels of oil per day, was shut down last week. No reason was, however, offered for the latest fault on the important crude oil transport channel, which delivers the product to the Bonny Export Terminal in Port Harcourt – the Rivers State capital. Reuters quotes a source in Shell as saying that the Trans-Niger pipeline was the only conduit for the much sort after Bonny light. NCTL was in April 2019 put under force majeure due to a fire outbreak. The pipeline was reopened in May and has now been shut down again.
