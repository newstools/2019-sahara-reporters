Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu has ordered Omoyele Sowore and Olawale Bakare to take their plea on the alleged treasonable felony and cyberstalking President Muhammadu Buhari. The defence counsel, Mr. Olumide Fusika, had told the court that the defendants were not in the best position to take their plea because the Department of State Services (DSS) have denied them access to their lawyers since the charge was served.
