 Former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, has accused leaders of the Southern part of Nigeria of being “weak and cowardly”. In a post on Twitter on Tuesday, Fani-Kayode said that Southern leaders were also “divided”. He also said that they consistently put Nigeria's interest first as opposed to considering Southern interest. He said, “The problem of Nigeria is not the North, it is the South. The North has strong, united and courageous leaders who put the Northern interest before the Nigerian interest. “The South has weak, divided and cowardly leaders who put the Nigerian interest before the Southern interest.”
