Daily Trust The House of Representatives says it will investigate thecircumstances that led to the $9.6 billion judgment recently securedby Process and Industrial Developments Limited in a United Kingdomcourt against Nigeria.The house also resolved to invite the Attorney-General of theFederation, Abubakar Malami and the Minister of State for Petroleum,Timipre Sylva, for interrogation.This was sequel to the adoption of a motion by Julius Ihonvbere, atyesterday’s plenary, titled, ‘Motion for the Urgent Need toInvestigate the Act of Negligence in the Handling of the Process andIndustrial Development Limited’s Transaction by the Ministry ofJustice and Ministry of Petroleum Resources, Respectively'.He urged the House to set up an  ad hoc committee “to as a matter ofurgency, invite the ministers of both ministries as well as otherofficials of the ministries saddled with the responsibility tonegotiate the agreement with P&ID and the prosecution of the matterbefore the tribunal, to give situational report on the matter andexplain the lapse in judgment of time and due diligence in the(miss)handling of the case, with a view to finding lasting solutionsto the avalanche of extant and future cases".The 17-man panel, set up by Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila, was mandated torecommend appropriate sanctions where necessary “without fear orfavour or preference for status” in line with Order 14 of the StandingOrders of the House. Ihovbere said for a country with a foreignreserve of only $45bn and a sovereign debt profile of over $80bn, thedebt was punitive and would devastatingly affect Nigeria’s economy.He stated: “The House is aware of the fact that Nigeria has a penchantfor disregarding the sanctity of contracts and terms of the agreement,coupled with the failure of Nigeria’s representatives in many cases tocarefully or diligently scrutinize agreements they sign, knowing thatthe consequences will affect past and future generations.“The House is alarmed that the agreement was somewhat shrouded insecrecy and, as such, apparently dubiously procured as those who oughtto know about its existence did not. And more important, the relevantlaws in Nigeria for the transaction to be consummated were notapplied, especially Part IV of the Bureau of Public Procurement Act2007 which deals with the fundamental principles of procurement."
