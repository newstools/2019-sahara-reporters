The national and state house of assembly election petitions tribunal,sitting in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, has upheld the election ofChristopher Ekpenyong, striking out Senator Godswill Akpabio'spetition.In a judgment delivered on Wednesday, the tribunal held that the AkwaIbom North West senatorial district results announced by theIndependent National Electoral Commission (INEC) remained valid.Akpabio, the first petitioner had challenged the elections on theground that Ekpenyong was not duly elected by the majority of lawfulvotes cast and that the process that elected him contravened theElectoral Act.The court dismissed all the preliminary objections filed by all therespondents in the petition and resolved to settle the case on themerits, to wit: "Did the petitioner prove by admissible evidence thatthe election was invalid?"Did the first petitioner establish that he, Senator Godswill Akpabiowon the elections by polling the highest number of votes cast at theelections against Senator Christopher Ekpenyong who was declared awinner by the INEC?"Relying on the case of ANDREW v. INEC, the court thereupon held thatthe petitionerâ€™s evidence was too weak in all ramifications to provenon-compliance, which is the only ground for which nullification ofthe elections was sought.The court further stated that the petition failed to bring any witnessfrom the polling units and thus could not prove substantialnon-compliance with the Electoral Act.The court in the end, in a majority judgment of two justices (one ofthe three judges dissented), dismissed the petition and upheld thedeclaration of Ekpenyong as the winner of the February 23, 2019election.
