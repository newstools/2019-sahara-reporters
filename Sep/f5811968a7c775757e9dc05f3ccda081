West African leaders meet in the capital of Burkina Faso on Saturdayfor a summit expected to lead to an overhaul of the flailing attemptto roll back jihadism in the Sahel region, Agence France Pressereports.Most of the heads of ECOWAS, a grouping of 15 countries on WestAfrica's coast and hinterland, are expected to attend the specialone-day meeting, which will also be attended by Chad, Cameroon, andMauritania.Topping their agenda: the record of the so-called G5 Sahel -- afive-nation effort intended to combat terrorism in the fragile regionthat lies between the Sahara and Atlantic.Backed by former colonial power France, the G5 Sahel was created togreat fanfare in 2014.The centerpiece of its strategy has been an initiative, launched inJuly 2017, to pool 5,000 troops from Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali,Mauritania and Niger to wrench back control from ruthless jihadistgroups.But, hamstrung by insufficient funds, training, and equipment, theforce has only now reached a complement of 4,000 troops, and for manyanalysts seems to be losing the battle.The nimble rebels have spread from Mali to Burkina Faso and Niger, aswell as Chad.Their hit-and-run raids are inflicting a mounting human, economic andpolitical toll, sparking fears that the coastal countries to the southare next in line.Yet another example of the difficulties the region faces came onThursday, when two soldiers were killed in two simultaneous attacks inBurkina Faso's north, security sources told AFP. It was just thelatest in a series of deadly attacks on security forces in thelandlocked West African nation.Lassina Diarra, a regional political analyst, said scathingly theOuagadougou summit should "mark the burial" of the G5 Sahel."The ECOWAS countries have realized that they have to act... that theyare threatened," Diarra said.Mahamadou Savadogo, an academic at the CERRAD research unit intodemocracy and development at Senegal's Gaston Berger University, saidthe G5 Sahel "is almost on its knees. It started off the wrong way."UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also has a grim view of the situation."I totally believe we are not winning the war against terrorism in theSahel and that the operation should be strengthened," he said lastweek.The scale of the challenge facing the G5 Sahel force is huge.According to the US thinktank the Center for Strategic andInternational Studies (CSIS), the number of radical Islamist-linkedattacks in the Sahel has doubled each year since 2016.Last year, the tally was 465 -- more than one a day."Despite significant international engagement and investment, violentextremism is increasing," it said.The British humanitarian charity Oxfam says that 13 million people inthe region currently need help -- water, health, shelter, sanitationand education are needed in addition to food aid.- 'International coalition' -Against this grim background, Niger President Mahamadou Issoufou, at asummit of the African Union in July, called for the creation of an"international coalition" modelled on the lines of the loose alliancethat fought the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria.The idea of a wider international pitch also appeals to Ivory Coast,which in 2016 suffered a terror attack that claimed 19 lives.Its northern border has been declared by France's foreign ministry tobe an "orange" security risk -- French nationals are advised not to gothere unless necessary."MINUSMA (the UN mission in Mali) and the G5 Sahel are not enough. Wehave to find wider and more effective means of coordination," IvorianPresident Alassane Ouattara said.French President Emmanuel Macron, who has lobbied relentlessly fordonations for the G5 Sahel force, has also signalled a subtle shift intone.Flanked by German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the G7 summit inBiarritz last month, he said it was time "for change, in methods andscale."- Coastal concern -Savadogo said West Africa's coastal countries "have taken over theproblem. The structure (of the force) will be modified, although theoutside may be kept."A French security official, speaking on condition of anonymity,reacted guardedly to the potential outcome of the Ouagadougou summit."Another summit, another meeting, another meeting which ends in a callfor more cooperation... Perhaps. But at least you can see a movementfor change."Beyond the military realm, there is a widening acknowledgment amonganalysts, politicians and army officers themselves that security isonly one part of a much broader strategy to stabilize the Sahel.ECOWAS -- the Economic Community of West African States -- bringstogether 15 countries whose economies range from regional heavyweightsNigeria and Ivory Coast to the impoverished Liberia and Sierra Leone.Landlocked Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger are non-coastal states."There are many advantages in seeing the coastal countries taking overthe problem. Their economies are wealthier and they have a betterchance of luring international donors" for security and development,said Savadogo.
