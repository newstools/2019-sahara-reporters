Barcelona superstar, Lionel Messi, has denied media reports that he told the Barcelona board to resign Neymar Jr from Paris Saint-Germain. Messi, however, acknowledged that he gave his opinion to the club about resigning the Brazilian playmaker. In an interview with Sport, Messi said his teammates did not push for the signing but stated that he would love for him to return to the club. Messi said, “A lot of things are said. We didn't ask for his signing. Obviously, we commented on it when we heard Neymar might come, we gave our opinions on whether it was good or not. “We never said he had to be signed. We didn't impose anything. We gave our opinion in the same way we did with Antoine Griezmann and other players who have come or who haven't arrived in the end. “I would have loved Neymar to come. I understand the people who were against it. It's normal after everything that happened with Neymar because of how he went and how he left us.” Messi said though the return of Neymar would boost the chances of the club to win trophies, he noted that some of the players do not want him to return, according to UK’s Evening Standard. “It's normal and logical that there are many people who don't want him to come back but thinking in sporting terms, for me Neymar is one of the best in the world. “Obviously, in our team, he would have increased the chance of achieving the results we want so much. “I don't know if the club wanted that or not. But from what I know, Ney really wanted it. “I also understand that it's very difficult to negotiate with Paris (Saint-Germain) after all the twists and turns they have had with Barcelona.”
