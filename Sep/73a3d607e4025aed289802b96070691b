The Department of Petroleum Resources has threatened to withdraw the operational licenses issued to Oando and four other filling stations in Adamawa State. Acting Controller of DPR in the state, Laminga Mohammed, said the affected filling stations were caught under-dispensing petroleum products to customers. Speaking with journalists in Yola, the capital, on Friday, Mohammed said, “DPR has sealed five filling stations in Southern Adamawa during its routine monitoring exercise. “We are warning that DPR will withdraw the operational licence of any filling station caught engaging in sharp practices. “A situation where you pay for 10 litres but get only eight litres cannot be tolerated.”
