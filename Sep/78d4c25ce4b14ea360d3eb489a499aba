  The special envoy sent to South Africa by President Muhammadu Buhari, has returned to Abuja after meeting with South Africa’s President, Cyril Ramaphosa, according to a report by Channels TV. The special envoy, Ambassador Ahmed Abubakar, held a meeting with Ramaphosa on Friday afternoon where he conveyed Buhari’s concern over recent xenophobic attacks on Nigerians and other African migrants in South Africa. Though Abubakar did not make any comment after the meeting, South African officials however, hinted of Buhari’s State visit to South Africa next month as scheduled. Ramaphosa thereafter reaffirmed his country’s relationship with Nigeria, insisting that it remains firm and strong and that the two partners were resolute in their shared commitment to build a continent at peace with itself and others.
