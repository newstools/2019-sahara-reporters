 President Muhammadu Buhari has urged his South African counterpart, Cyril Ramaphosa, to take visible measures and end xenophobic attacks on Nigerians living in South Africa. Buhari had sent a special envoy led by Director-General, National Intelligence Agency, Ambassador Ahmed Rufai Abubakar, to South Africa after another wave of xenophobic attacks on Nigerians and other African migrants in that country. According to Special Adviser to Buhari on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, the envoy expressed the concern of the President and Nigerians about intermittent violence against citizens and their property/business interests in South Africa and the need to find a lasting solution. He said, “President Buhari stressed the need for South African Government to take visible measures to stop violence against citizens of brotherly African nations. “President Buhari is worried that the recurring issue of xenophobia could negatively affect the image and standing of South Africa as one of the leading countries on the continent if nothing is done to stop it.” On his part, President Ramaphosa reaffirmed his stand against criminality and committed to do everything possible to protect the rights of every Nigerian and foreign nationals in the country.
