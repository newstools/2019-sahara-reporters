  President of Spanish football club – Barcelona – Josep Bartomeu, has said that star player, Lionel Messi, was free to leave the club at the end of the current season if he wishes. According to Bartomeu, the club was not worried about Messi’s future despite a clause in his new contract that allows him to end his contract beforehand. The Argentine, who is a five-time Ballon d’Or winner, signed a new four-year deal with Barcelona in 2017, raising hopes of remaining with the club till the end of his career. But events of recent past have suggested that things may end up differently especially with throwing all the blame of the club’s latest European disappointments on the 32-year-old. Bartomeu said, “Leo Messi has a contract through to the 2020/21 season but the player is able to leave Barca before the final season. “It’s the same case as with the final contracts that Xavi, (Carles) Puyol and (Andres) Iniesta had. “They are players who deserve that liberty and we shouldn’t worry as they are very committed to Barca. “We want Messi to play for Barca through to 2021 and beyond. We are very calm.”
