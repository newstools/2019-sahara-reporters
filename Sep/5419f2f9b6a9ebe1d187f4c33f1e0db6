  Boris Johnson has suffered another humiliating Commons defeat afterhis second bid for a snap general election was rejected by MPs.The Prime Minister said he wanted to head to the polls next month tobreak the political deadlock, as he accused opposition parties ofmaking “outrageous excuses” to delay.But Labour and other opposition MPs refused to back the bid – whichneeded a two-thirds majority in the Commons – while the risk of ano-deal remained.MPs voted 293 to 46, short of the 434 needed – marking the new PM’ssixth Commons defeat.The prorogation, passed in the early hours of Tuesday, makes a generalelection extremely unlikely until at least mid-November.
