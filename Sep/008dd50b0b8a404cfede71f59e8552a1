Fresh indications have emerged that military troops deployed to fightBoko Haram terrorists in the North-East are using outdated weapons andequipment, including failing Shilka guns procured during theadministration of late Alhaji Shehu Shagari, who was the president ofNigeria between 1979 and 1983.This development, according to top military officers who spoke withPunch on the condition of anonymity, has exposed Nigerian troops atthe battlefront to attacks by the terrorists, especially ISWAPfighters, who are said to have more sophisticated weapons. They notedthat it was also responsible for the heavy casualties the country hadsuffered in the anti-insurgency war in recent times, noting that therewere times the Shagari-era weapons failed during operations.The top military officers explained that Shilka, an artillery gunmounted on fighting vehicles, being used by the Nigerian troops at thebattlefront are outdated but that they were refurbished and deployedfor the operation. They noted that such refurbished arms could notwithstand the modern ones used by the insurgents and that there weretimes they packed up during operations.One of the officers said, “The Shilka guns were acquired underShagari’s government. We have many of them but they are outdated, sothey were refurbished, even though a lot of their components aremissing. However, they were deployed in the North-East for theanti-insurgency war like that, hence they fail during battles.“Recently, Boko Haram even stole one from the troops. So, while we arebattling with the refurbished Shilka, ISWAP fighters deploy the latesttechnology to attack us, and you know the President said a week ago atan ECOWAS meeting that how the terrorists deploy more sophisticatedweapons is a matter of concern.”Another officer, who is currently engaged in operations in one of thetoughest operational zones in the North-East, said apart from Shilka,they used to have in their inventory Tank 72, also known as T-72,which was made in Russia and manufactured in 1971 but sold out in1972. T-72 are Soviet-era tanks.He added, “They were procured by former President Goodluck Jonathan’sadministration towards the 2015 elections and they were used tocapture lost territories, but unfortunately, the tanks came withoutspare parts.“From time to time, we cannibalized one to fix another until theybroke down and they were withdrawn from operations because there wereno spare parts. What we have now is called  Vickers MBT (Vickers MainBattle Tanks).“They are even older than the T-72. So, as I’m talking to you, Shilkais what we have and the outdated guns we were supplied with and thatis why the insurgents seem to be having the upper hand. The equipmentis really outdated.”In a similar revelation, another top military officer at thebattlefront told the newspaper that the attacks on soldiers hadincreased in recent times because the insurgents were now using theweapons and equipment they once stole from the military.He noted that superior weapons and equipment, like Armoured PersonnelCarrier and Mine-Resistant Ambush, Protected vehicles, popularly knownas MRAP, which is both bullet- and bomb-proof, were urgently needed bythe troops.Meanwhile, the sources explained further that beyond using drones, theinsurgents were now using night vision goggles, thermal detectors andother modern equipment to attack the Nigerian troops.The Nigerian Army had in November 2018 pointed out that Boko Haram’sattacks on troops had revealed that the insurgents were using dronesand foreign fighters.
