Argentina and Barcelona star, Lionel Messi, has won the best men's player at the FIFA Awards in Milan, Italy. Messi beat Juventus' Cristiano Ronaldo and Liverpool's Virgil van Dijk to claim the top prize. It is the sixth time Messi has been voted the best player in the world. In other category, Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, won the men's coach of the year, defeating Manchester City's Pep Guardiola and Tottenham's Mauricio Pochettino in the process. Liverpool goalkeeper, Alisson Becker, was named the best goalkeeper ahead of Manchester City's Ederson and Barcelona's Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Leeds United boss, Marcelo Bielsa, won the fair play award after he ordered his team to allow Aston Villa to score an uncontested equaliser during their 1-1 draw in their Championship match in April. Eighteen-year-old Daniel Zsori won the Puskas award for the best goal with his spectacular 93rd-minute overhead kick for Debrecen against Ferencvaros, moments after coming on as substitute for his Hungarian league debut in February. His strike beat Messi's chip from the edge of the penalty area against Real Betis and Juan Quintero's powerful 30-yard free-kick for River Plate against Racing Club.
