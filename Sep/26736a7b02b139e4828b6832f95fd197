In a collaborative effort to improve the methodology and technology of building construction, the Nigerian Institute of Building has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Australian Institute of Building. The MoU, which was signed in Sydney, Australia, is aimed at making the NIOB and AIB have a shared commitment to become a stronger professional institute and educator within the construction industry. According to the National President of AIB, Mr David Burnell, AIB and NIOB will work together to raise the level of professionalism in the construction industry and education in Australia and Nigeria. The National President of NIOB, Mr Kunle Awobodu, said, “The collaboration among members of the two institutes would promote research in the field of construction and also encourage greater participation of members in jointly organised construction events for valuable Continuing Professional Development (CPD). “The two parties also agreed to exchange information relevant to the development of the building construction management profession in Australia and Nigeria in order to facilitate an understanding of each other’s work.”
