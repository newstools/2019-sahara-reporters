 The federal high court in Ikoyi, Lagos has granted the final forfeitureÂ the $40 million worth of pieces of jewellery seized from Diezani Alison-Madueke, the former minister of Petroleum Resources, to the Nigerian government. Justice Nicholas Oweibo ordered the forfeiture on Tuesday. He said the former minister failed to show cause why the pieces of jewellery should not be forfeited to the federal government.
