  Motorists and commuters plying the Benin-Warri-Sapele Road in Delta State have been left to groan with pains over the deplorable condition of the road. Speaking to SaharaReporters, travellers, who were stranded on the road on Wednesday, expressed displeasure over the way and manner it had been neglected by the state and federal governments without recourse to the sufferings of motorists. One road user, who identified himself only as Jude, said, “Barely a month after the road got dilapidated, subjecting road users to agony for hours, the state and federal governments have not made any single move to address the situation. This is very sad.” Also speaking, a former ward councillor from Sapele, who preferred not to be named, said, “This is Benin-Warri-Sapele Road as of today. “You cannot successfully travel from Warri to Sapele and Benin without spending three hours or more. We are in a crude oil generating state. We have a governor in this state. Yes it is a federal government road and the question is who uses it? “If this is not wickedness then what really can we call this? How can it take me less 35 minutes to fly from Lagos to Benin and take me another four hours from Benin to Warri. “It is supposed to be the responsibility of government but we have to beg them because suppression has eaten into the brains of citizens. Our rights are now privileges.” Meanwhile, the Delta State Government has said it will not intervene to remedy any failed portion of federal roads across the state as a result of an existing contract, which the federal government claimed to have awarded. Briefing journalists on the decision, Commissioner for Information in Delta, Charles Aniagwu, said, “The Delta State Government will not intervene to remedy the failed portions of federal roads across the state due to an existing contract which the federal government claimed to have awarded.”
