Nigerian Army Travellers in commercial vehicles moving in and out of Maiduguri,Borno State, are currently being extorted the sum of N200 per personfor failing to provide their national identification cards forclearance to enter the city.Daily Trust reports that travellers have to pay N200 at somecheckpoints situated on the outskirts of the metropolis.“This practice has been in place for four to five years. A combinedteam of Immigration Service and the military working at the entranceof this town have been collecting N200 from all passengers who couldnot produce their national ID cards,” said a Hiace bus driver onarrival at a checkpoint in Maiduguri.The driver, who parked by the roadside at Jimtilo area, awaiting hispassengers to do their clearance with some Immigration personnel,added that it was only “that type of National ID cards” that werebeing required for the identification clearance at the checkpoint.“Any passenger, who fails to produce the National ID card must payN200 at this checkpoint whether they are coming in or going out ofMaiduguri. And therefore, we have been experiencing delays on ourjourneys to and from the city.“Because, the authorities here insist on one type of identificationcards which many passengers do not possess, and most of the passengersare not willing to pay that N200 as a fine and so, the authoritieswould ask the drivers to offload all the luggage belonging to theerring passenger which is very difficult and time-consuming,” thedriver explained.A passenger, Rebecca, who was aboard a Hiace bus along Bama road,heading to Gwoza town, told our correspondent that she has been payingN200 for failing to produce her ID card.“Since the road to Gwoza was reopened, I have been paying this N200 atsome checkpoints till I reach Gwoza town. I do have two other IDcards, but they only require that specifically, which I couldn’t gettime to obtain,” she said.However, the Operation Positive Identification which was inauguratedon Monday by the Theatre Command of the Operation Lafiya Dole did notspecify the 'national ID card' as the only means of identification.“Troops are directed to strictly check legitimate means ofidentification such as national identification card, votersregistration card, drivers’ license, and passport or other validofficial identification before allowing such persons passage,” said astatement on Monday by the Nigerian Army spokesman at the command,Col. Ado Isa.“Consequently, Operation Positive Identification is seriously ongoingacross the North-East. Members of the public are requested tocooperate with the troops by moving along with valid identificationcards and present same to the troops in the efforts to rid theNorth-East zone of criminals fleeing for safety,” the statement added.
