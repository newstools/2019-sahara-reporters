The trial of Senator Elisha Abbo was stalled at the Zuba magistrate's court in Abuja today (Tuesday). He was said to be ill. The lawmaker is standing trial for assaulting a nursing woman in a sex toy shop. His lawyer, Adegbite Adeniyi, told the court that his client was suffering from "acute febrile" illness and was not available for the trial. He also acknowledged the receipt of the proof of evidence served on Abbo by the prosecution, adding that they needed more time to go through it and to enable them to prepare defence. The prosecution counsel, James Idachaba, did not raise any objection to the reason for the non-appearance of the senator in the court, admitting that anybody could fall sick.
