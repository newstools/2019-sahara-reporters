Son of late Afrobeat legend, Fela Kuti, Seun, has called on Nigerians to fight for themselves, saying RevolutionNowis not for special people but everyone. He said this at a symposium organised by the Coalition For Revolution on Monday in Lagos. Seun said, “For me, the matter ofRevolutionNowis not whether we are law-abiding or not. “The matter is for the collective interest of the people of this country, for children unborn. “Revolution is not a work of putting one man at the forefront that can save everyone. Everyone must save themselves and until the people of Nigeria are ready to save themselves, nobody can save them. “We need to go and do the work of waking up our communities. Revolution is not for any special group of people. It is for everyone.” Speaking further, Seun called for the release of pro-democracy activist, Omoyele Sowore, who has remained in Department of State Services detention since his arrest on August 3 in Lagos. He added, “We must stand firm for the release of our comrade, Sowore. We must stand firm and secure his release.”
