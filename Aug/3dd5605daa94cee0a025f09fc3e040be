A federal high court sitting in Abuja will on Wednesday hear the motion filed by the human right crusader, Omoyele Sowore, challenging his detention by the Department of State Services. Sowore had on 9 August challenged a court order which allowed the Nigerian government to detain him for 45 days. In the motion, he asked the court to set aside its order permitting the DSS to detain him for 45 days. The court had delayed in hearing the matter which compelled his lawyer, Femi Falana, to approach the court seeking a date for the hearing of the application. Filed along with his application was an affidavit of urgency seeking an urgent hearing of the suit on the ground that it â€œis one of fundamental importance that affects salient fundamental rights of the applicant herein".
