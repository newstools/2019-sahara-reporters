The police in Plateau State have been arrested 11 persons for attacking the state-owned polytechnic staff quarters and kidnapping residents. Among those kidnapped by the gang is the younger sister of the institution’s Assistant Registrar, Abigail Amos, and the 12-year-old son of the institution’s Chaplain, Kim Dido. The two regained their freedom after an unspecified amount of ransom was paid to their abductors. Commissioner of Police in the state, Isaac Akinmoyede, while parading the suspects at the command’s headquarters in Jos, the capital, on Thursday, gave their names as Bashiru Mohammed, Umar Adamu, Yusuf Adamu, Mustapha Mohammed and Shaibu Ado.
