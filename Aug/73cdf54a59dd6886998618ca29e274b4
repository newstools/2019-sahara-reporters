Immediate-past governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha, has said that his successor, Emeka Ihedioha, was on a Vendetta against him. In a statement on Thursday by his spokesperson, Sam Onwuemeodo, in Owerri, capital of Imo, Okorocha advised Ihedioha to borrow a cue from Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, and consolidate on the efforts of his predecessor. The statement read, “On Wednesday, August 14, 2019, Governor Emeka Ihedioha announced the constitution of a seven-man panel on lands’ allocations from June 2006 to May 2019. “Looking at the members of the panel, who are all card-carrying members of the PDP and their terms of reference, one would have no other option than to conclude that the governor as usual, has his target or mission, which is to continue his vendetta against the past APC administration in the state and the man who headed it, Senator Rochas Okorocha. “Governor Ihedioha has set up more than 14 committees and panels since he became governor and each of the committees or panels has one or two specific assignments to carry out and all against the APC government which Senator Okorocha had led. “We would only ask Governor Ihedioha to borrow a leaf from his fellow PDP governor, who also succeeded an APC governor in Oyo State, Seyi Makinde, who said that he wouldn’t cancel APC administration’s good policies. “That is how a governor who means well should reason or act, because at the end of the day, the overall interest of the state and her people should remain the ultimate goal.”
