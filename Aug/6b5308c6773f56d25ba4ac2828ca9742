The Central Bank of Nigeria has urged the general public to deposit overused or mutilated naira notes to the nearest bank. To improve the overall quality of naira notes in circulation, the CBN has introduced the Clean Note Policy and Banknotes Fitness Guidelines. The CBN said, “If you have in your possession, overused or mutilated naira notes, you are required by the Central Bank of Nigeria to deposit such notes at any branch near you on or before Monday, September 2, 2019. “Please note that overused notes include any naira denomination that is now weak to such an extent that it could easily tear at further handling or processing. “Mutilated notes include any naira note that has been partially or permanently damaged, but which clearly still has more than half of its original size together. “As Nigerians, it is our patriotic and collective responsibility to handle the naira with care.”
