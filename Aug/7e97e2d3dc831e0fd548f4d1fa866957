The Centre for Anti-Corruption and Open Leadership has accused a former governor of Abia State, Orji Uzor Kalu, of plotting another medical trip overseas to stall his ongoing corruption trial. Chairman of the group, Debo Adeniran, said this in a statement on Monday. He said, “The fresh plot by the former governor of Abia State to re-enact his fake foreign medical trip is a renewed bid to stall his trial. “It was said that the defence against him would start on Monday before the Federal High Court in Lagos. “Also, it was gathered that the former governor and his cohort are working towards another fake medical trip in order to frustrate his resumed hearing for the second time.” The trial of Kalu was stalled on Monday due to the absence of his lawyer. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission is prosecuting him and two others for money laundering and conspiracy. Adeniran added, “We urge the court to expedite action on the former governor in order to restore public confidence in the anti-corruption crusade of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government. “Also, probing all financial dealings of ex-governors with a view to bringing culprits to book and recovering much of the stolen wealth, would go a long way in ameliorating the social frustration and economic downturn in the polity.”
