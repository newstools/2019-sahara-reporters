Finally, President Muhammadu Buhari-backed security operatives have allowed organizers of the #RevolutionNow symposium gain access to the event's venue. The police and other security agents had laid siege to the Ikeja venue as early as 7 am. This was made possible after human rights lawyer, Femi Falana, had an extensive discussion with the security operatives. The symposium is expected to start soon.
