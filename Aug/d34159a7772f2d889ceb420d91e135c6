It wasn’t really adistant farm, it is a nearby farm because people are not leaving farfrom the location, so we saw her corpse and on getting there we sawher undies were torn apart, lying by the side, she sustained stabbingon her hands and at the back of her neck and she is dead already."We called the police who have visited the scene and took photographsof the whole situation. The body has been deposited in the mortuary.”Speaking about her likely killer, he stated: "Isn’t that obvious? TheFulani. There was this Fulani group with their cattle within that areathat we know and when this thing happened, they moved out, theyrelocated. It couldn’t have been any other person; indigenes couldn’tjust have attacked fellow indigenes and an old woman for that matterin her late 60s.“She is an old woman and it couldn’t have been any other person thatcan perpetuate that type of action from the same community. So we aresure it’s the Fulani and that’s the obvious fact there. If the policewant, let them do their investigation and state the fact. We know whatthe country is and we pray that justice will take its course.”
