The Government of South Africa has expressed concern over the call by the National Association of Nigerian Students for the expulsion of South Africans and their investments in Nigeria. The country made its feelings known in a statement by Counsellor in-charge of Political Affairs at the South African High Commission, Abuja, Anna-Maria Jojozi, on Sunday. Jojozi said, “I wish to express my department’s concern regarding statements said to emanate from student organisation in Nigeria, calling for expulsion of South Africans and protests at South African owned businesses. “The protests are said to be in response to alleged killings of Nigerians by South Africans; as you are aware, these allegations are devoid of truth, reckless and unwarranted.
