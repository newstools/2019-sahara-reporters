The World Bank and the African Development Bank have barred about 16 Nigerian companies from being awarded any of its financed contracts over infractions on corruption. The banks released the names of companies and individual that have been blacklisted for two years because they had been sanctioned under the bank's fraud and corruption policy as set forth in the procurement guidelines and the consultant guidelines.

The companies sectioned include Idemia Nigeria Limited (formerly Oberthur Technologies Nigeria Limited), Best Scan Solutions Limited, Quick Projects Limited, and Marabef Global Limited. Others are Lutoyilex Construct Limited,  Efemaz Construction & General Services Limited, Oceanic Construction & Engineering Nigeria Limited, and Snc-Lavalin International (Nigeria) Limited.
