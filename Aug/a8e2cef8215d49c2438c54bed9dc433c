President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday in Daura expressed his gratitude to Katsina State Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, for building a 38-km road for his "constituency". President Buhari thanked Governor Masari while inaugurating the re-designed and re-constructed Fago-Katsayal-Kwasarawa-Jirdede-Koza Road during his visit to the state. “Thank you, Governor Masari, for taking care of the people of my constituency," he said. The road, covering about 38 kilometres and linking four local government areas, was first constructed by the defunct Petroleum Trust Fund, which was then headed by President Buhari, and it was extended to Dangwara, Jirdede and Koza towns. The road has the benefit of increased mobility that will enable the predominantly farming population to optimally utilize the Koza dam and serves as a vital route option from Kano, Jigawa, and Yobe to the famous Mai’Adua International Border Market. Meanwhile, Katsina has remained a hotbed of violence as bandits continue to ravage the state.
