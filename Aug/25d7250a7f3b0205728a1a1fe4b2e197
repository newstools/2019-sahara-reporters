Betty Anyanwu-Akeredolu Women in Ondo including girls, are set to be trained on how to defend themselves against rapists. The women will be equipped with Taekwondo skills under an initiative put together by the First Lady of the state, Betty Anyanwu-Akeredolu. The governor's wife said the move was important so as to protect females against sexual predators in the country. The initiative was inspired by the alleged rape of a female undergraduate of the Adekunle Ajasin University in Akungba Akoko by some soldiers recently. The First Lady said, "We are going to promote Taekwondo in Ondo State, all our daughters will learn Taekwondo for their safety. "If that AAUA student had the skill, those randy soldiers couldn’t have been able to overcome her." While calling for stiffer penalties against rapists, the governor's wife said she was prepared to continue to raise her voice against criminal acts in the society.
