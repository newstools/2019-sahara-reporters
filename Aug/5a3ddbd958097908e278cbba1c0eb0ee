An investigation carried out by SaharaReporters has revealed that theintruder into the restricted area of the Murtala MuhammedInternational Airport (MMIA), one Usman Adamu has been deported backto his country, Niger Republic.A source close to the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) in AbujaSaharaReporters that Adamu who on July 19, was spotted on the wing ofan Azman aircraft that was preparing to take off out of Lagos to PortHarcourt was allegedly found to be mentally imbalanced after somepsychiatric tests were carried out on him.The source said Adamu was deported Friday last week by road through Lagos.The immigration source said the service carried out profiling and,interrogation on the suspect, but was found to be unstable.The source said: “Immediately he was arrested at the airport, bysecurity agencies, he was interrogated and asked series of questions,and later taken to the psychiatric hospital for a test. It was at thehospital that it was confirmed that he had a mental challenge.“But despite that, he was still kept in detention for another round ofquestioning, which didn’t produce any meaningful result. So, he washanded over to us and as the law required, we returned him to hiscountry.”Series of reactions had trailed his access to the area of the airport,while the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), hadimmediately suspended the security officers on duty at the time, whilealso taking responsibility for the breach.For instance, the industry unions had said they had been vindicated bythe breach.Comrade Abdulrasaq Saidu, the General Secretary of the Association ofNigerian Aviation Professionals (ANAP) had told journalists in Lagosthat rather than recruit qualified personnel for the position ofAviation Security, a department under FAAN, politicians had hijackedactivities in the sector by engaging their cronies into the sensitiveaspect of the industry.He alleged that the industry had been polarised in the past fouryears, insisting that those above 30 years were being recruited toAVSEC as against the extant rule.He further purported that the government through the Ministry ofTransport, Aviation Unit, had jettisoned the compulsory backgroundchecks for impending new recruits, warning that the problem maypersist if there was no change in the current system.
