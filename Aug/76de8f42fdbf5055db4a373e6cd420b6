The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and China National Offshore Oil Corporation have restated their commitment to work together to improve the petroleum industry in both countries. Group Managing Director of NNPC, Mele Kyari, disclosed this when the Executive Vice President of CNOOC, Mr Lu Yan Ji, paid him a visit in Abuja, on Thursday. Spokesperson for the NNPC, Ndu Ughamadu, in a statement, quoted Kyari as saying that the partnership would also help Nigeria to achieve 3million barrels of oil per day target by 2023. The statement while commending the CNOOC for its plan to expand its investment in Nigeria’s oil industry, added that there was need to improve the country’s revenue profile through new investments. Kyari said, “To have investment of $16bn in Nigeria is clearly an indication of your confidence in us. “We have a target to grow production to three million barrels per day by 2023, to do that, we need partners like you. You can count on us because we have common interest.” Speaking during the visit, Lu said Nigeria was one of his company’s largest investment destination. He called for NNPC’s support in securing the investments, adding that there was need for both national oil corporations to work closely.
