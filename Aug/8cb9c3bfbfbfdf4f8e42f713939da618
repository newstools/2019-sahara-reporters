A federal high court sitting in Abuja has declined to hear the motion filed by Sowore as the court referred the matter back to the vacation judge Justice Taiwo Taiwo. Justice Nkweonye Maha said she did not have the jurisdiction to review the decision by Justice Taiwo Taiwo. She noted that the ruling of the vacation judge stated the matter would be held 45 days September 21.
