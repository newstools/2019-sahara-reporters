A civil society organization, Empowerment for Unemployed Youth Initiative, says more than 80 percent of soldiers killed in the line of duty fighting the Boko Haram insurgency are young Nigerians. It, therefore, urged the President Muhammadu Buhari regime to establish “education fund” to carter for children of Nigeria’s fallen heroes. National Coordinator of the group, Solomon Adodo, stated this at a press conference in Abuja on Monday to mark 2019 International Youth Day. “Nigerian youths have proven over time to be brave and patriotic and the least the nation can do in appreciation is not to allow their dreams perish with them. More than 80 percent of soldiers who have lost their lives fighting insurgents and other criminal elements were youths and these youths have wives and children.“One of the ways the federal government can show appreciation for the ultimate price paid by these heroes is to float a fund that will see to the education and welfare of the deceased families. We acknowledge that the Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai, has taken initiative to ensure that troops are properly cared for," Adodo said. Continuing, he stated, “We appeal to the federal government to pay particular attention to the needs of the Nigerian Army and other security outfits for their arduous efforts in maintaining Nigeria’s territorial integrity. “In view of the complexities involved in fighting insurgency, we use this medium to appeal to all Nigerians to be conscious of the comments they make about our military and security agencies bearing in mindthat whatever is said would either encourage or dampen the morale of the troops.“All that we ought to do at this point in time is to show solidarity with our troops to completely flush out terrorists and other criminal elements in our country for the good of all. “The Nigerian military has recorded tremendous success and much more can be achieved with our renewed support."
