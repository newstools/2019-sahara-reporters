Immediate-past governor of Lagos State, Akinwunmi Ambode, has said that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission is yet to directly communicate with him on the investigation of his administration or any subject matter. Ambode said this while speaking after officials of the anti-graft agency raided his houses in Epe and Parkview, Ikoyi, Lagos. The EFCC operatives searched his Parkview residence but met stiff opposition by kinsmen and neighbours in Epe. The ex-governor, in a statement by his media aide, Mr Habib Aruna, said while the EFCC had not directly communicated with him, he is “ready and willing to respond” whenever the anti-graft agency does.
