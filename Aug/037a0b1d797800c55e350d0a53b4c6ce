By the unlawful Gestapo arrest, clandestine detention and politicallymotivated persecution of Omoyele Sowore, the Department of StateService, DSS, have shown that it is markedly subnormal in function,flawed in intelligence and rascal in behaviour.Nigeria is currently perplexed, bedevilled and overwhelmed by thelethality of marauding Fulani Herdsmen, widespread kingpin kidnappers,armed robbery and a regional terrorist organization - Boko Haram.Unfortunately for us as a country, we have a domestic intelligenceagency (DSS) known for its deficiency in intelligence andfunctionality.The activities of criminal-classed elements like Fulani Herdsmen,kingpin kidnappers, and Boko Haram are evasive to the intelligenceradar of the DSS.But the moment patriotic citizens become critical of the governmentfor its stalled policies and poor performances, they automaticallycome under the radar of the DSS.Obviously, this goes to prove that the DSS is merely a politicalstooge that responds to opposition based on the mood of the president.Instead of a vibrantly energetic and engaging domestic intelligenceagency that functions as the source of reliable information formitigating our various internal security challenges, our moribund DSSis all about the pettiness of arrests and illegal detentions.The calculated use of violence against our country by Fulani Herdsmen,Boko Haram and other criminal groups with felonious intent have neverfor once been comprehended by the radar coverage of our so-called DSSdomestic intelligence.Isn't that a big shame?The DSS should be publicly condemned and criticized for its subnormalintelligence and defective predisposition.When Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, MACBAN,threatened to attack the five South-eastern state of the country overthe purported stubbornness of their governors, the DSS was so docileand unpatriotic to await news of their violent disturbances.The intelligence radar of the DSS didn't capture, interpret andanalyze such inciting remark as the incentive for action by FulaniHerdsmen against our country.They watched the broad savages and excessive killings of our people byFulani Herdsmen with the least concern.The Department of State Service, DSS, primarily established fordomestic intelligence, presently do not have the structural competenceand expertise for information gathering.That is the reason the agency relies on online gossips and maliciouslydivulged information for the sensitive job of domestic intelligence.If the DSS truly have the structural competence for domesticintelligence, their analysis, investigation, forecasting, andstrategic planning would have thoroughly processed and deducedSowore's #RevolutionNow protest to be civil.If the #RevolutionNow protest was actually a call for the overthrow ofthis government as it is being alleged by the DSS against OmoyeleSowore, the Nigerian society would have seen a bit of that in actionby now.Today, interestingly, there is no one person linked to Sowore that hasdisturbed the peace of this country!But because the DSS is subnormal in intelligence and defective inpredisposition, they acted in error and still find it very hard toswallow their shameless pride.Globally, domestic intelligence agencies are mainly for internalsecurity, counterintelligence; whereas overseas espionages are mainlyfor foreign spies.Domestic intelligence service is also supposed to be responsible foridentifying foreign spies employed by foreign services against acountry.In 2011, Russian domestic intelligence service, the FSB, exposed 199foreign spies, including 41 professional spies and 158 agents employedby foreign intelligence services against the Russian government.In 2006, the FSB reportedly caught about 27 foreign intelligenceofficers and 89 foreign agents.How many has the DSS caught? None! Why? They are nonentity - jobless!If the DSS understands the danger of the activities of foreignespionages in our country, they'd resign from their pettiness andbecome serious for once.One of the activities of foreign espionages in a country is to gainaccess to the country's internet space without anyone knowing theiridentity.They place propagandas and disinformation on the local internet spaceof the country to whitewash the spy's country foreign policy andcreate a good image for themselves; but then, they intentionally causeanti-government feelings in the foreign country to cause dissensionand unrest.Nigeria is presently under the attack of cyber espionages that arenegatively influencing the thoughts and feelings of Nigerians throughonline contents that ridicule our government and undermine our abilityof self-governance.But because the DSS do not have the structural competence to checkmatethe economic security threat of foreign espionages in our country'sinternet space, they do not know the danger their activities portendfor our country and the negative feelings of dissension that theyarouse in our people.I'm writing this to tell the DSS to release Omoyele Sowore with anapology to him because Sowore is not a threat to this country.Arresting Sowore and using a court's exparte order to detain him forfurther investigation is a contrive that demonstrates DSS' desperationand want of damaging information to prove their case against Sowore.Why arrest someone you still need to investigate to find culpable foran alleged crime before being bold to charge to court?As a domestic intelligence agency, your intelligence data and analysisshould have found him culpable of the alleged crime of treasonablefelony before enforcing an arrest.There are several threats against the territorial integrity ofNigeria; Boko Haram and Fulani Herdsmen are some of them. Sowore isnot one of them.The DSS should stop harassing those who are not against Nigeria.#Free_Sowore_Now!Martin White-Ufuah, a writer and columnist, writes from Abuja.
