Smart Adeyemi, the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the Kogi West senatorial district election, says his party is not afraid of a rerun.He said this while commending the judgment of the election petitions tribunal that sacked the lawmaker representing Kogi West, Senator Dino Melaye.Justice Anthony Chijioke-led panel of the  Kogi State election petitions tribunal had ordered a fresh election in the senatorial district.In his reaction, Senator Adeyemi noted that as a student of law, he had always believed that the court is where those who have been cheated get justice.He insisted that he would reclaim his mandate in the rerun ordered by the tribunal, stressing that he has built the image to win the election over the years.The two-time senator compared himself to Melaye who contested the election on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).He said, “We are not afraid to go for a rerun because the people can assess the two personalities. They know our antecedents, they know our track records, they know who we are and what we stand for.
