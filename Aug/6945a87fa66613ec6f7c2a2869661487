Vice President, Yemi Osibanjo, on Thursday said that there was a need for the government to change strategy on how electricity is supplied to homes and businesses across the country. The VP made the call during the launch of a 2x60MVA, 132/33kV substation and associated 132kV transmission lines at Abeokuta, Ogun State, according to a report by PUNCH. He said, “A substantial change of strategy is necessary. There is clearly a need for a change of strategy. “What we have done in the past has taken us to a point where there is clearly a need for change of strategy. “The distribution capacity in the 11 Discos are significantly low, hovering at around 4,000 megawatts on average with a peak at about 5,400MW. “So, despite all the availability of about 8,000MW of generation and 7,000MW of transmission capacity, the lack of Disco infrastructure to absorb and deliver grid power to end-users has largely restricted generation to an average of about 4,000MW, and sometimes even falling below 4,000MW.”
