Comedian, I Go Die, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to release pro-democracy activist, Omoyele Sowore, who was arrested and detained by the Department of State Services for echoing issues that need urgent attention in Nigeria. Sowore was arrested by the Nigerian Government for planning protests against bad governance in the country. In a post on Instagram on Thursday, I Go Die said, “President Muhammadu Buhari, you were 41 years old in 1983 when you overthrew Shehu Shagari, the first democratically elected President of Nigeria on December 31, 1983, and truncated our democracy at the time. “We cannot totally agree that all is well when more than 10 per cent of our population has left the country in search of greener pastures. What then is the hope of those left in the country? “The conscience of man is better than the laws of the white man. Please kindly treat Sowore as one of your sons whose ultimate goal is to have a better society. “I am human and I feel the pains of millions of Nigerians who sleep every day without a meal, blinded by a hopeless situation. “Please sir, on behalf of the voiceless, listen to the voice of reason, #FreeSowore and make Nigeria better than you met it.”
