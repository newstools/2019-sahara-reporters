Abike Dabiri-Erewa, Chairperson of the Nigerian Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM), says the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission assist to fight Nigerians committing cybercrimes abroad, asserting that a few people committing crime should not tarnish the image of a nation of 200 million citizens.Speaking during a visit to the anti-graft agency on Friday, Dabiri-Erewa said this would be done through the creation of a special desk that would focus on cybercrimes among Nigerians in the Diaspora.She said: “The commission will be working with the EFCC to have a special desk that will tackle cases like this; whether it’s about fraud, whether it’s about somebody cheating yo, we hope to partner with the EFCC to have a special desk to deal with cases involving those in the diaspora being defrauded or being cheated.“They should have somewhere to complain to and with EFCC, I’m sure we can provide those answers and solve those problems.“A few people committing crime should not tarnish the image of a nation of 200 million people. However, the world wants to see that we are doing something about cybercrime.“We are here with the EFCC to say Nigerians in the diaspora count on you to tackle cybercrime as effectively as you are tackling corruption in Nigeria so that those who perpetrate these crimes are brought to book.”
