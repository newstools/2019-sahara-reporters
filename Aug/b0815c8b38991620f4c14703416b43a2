Anambra State Police Command says its cops did not attack a98-year-old woman with an AK-47 rifle in the course of trying toarrest a suspect in the state.It was reported in the media that the alleged victim accused thepolice of hitting her with the rifle.But in a statement by SP Haruna Mohammed, spokesman for the command,the police said, "The attention of the Anambra State Police Commandhas been drawn to online media reports that 'Policemen attached to theCommand Special Anti-robbery Squad have allegedly beaten up a 98-yearsold Woman Cecilia Okpalaku of Achina in Aguata LGA of Anambra State,and assaulted her with Ak-47 rifle over a family dispute'. Thepublication is not only false but totally misleading."The real fact in issue was that on the 19/8/2019 the Commissioner ofPolice received a formal complaint from a legal practitioner that hisclient one Esther Nzekwe was assaulted by her fiancee one EmekaOkpalaku and that the man also confiscated her credentials includingher NYSC call up letter in order to prevent her from reporting to NYSCcamp which dateline closes on the 20/8/2019."The police further claimed, "The complainant further alleged that thesuspect was planning to travel back to Japan where he based. Followingthe petition, the Commissioner of Police CP John B.Abang ordered for afull-scale investigation into the matter. Police detectives visitedthe house to invite the suspect but as soon as he sighted the Police,he quickly ran inside the house and locked all the entrances."All efforts by the police to prevail on the suspect to open the doorsproved abortive until the police used the power of ingress inaccordance with section 7(1&2) CPA laws of the Federation to gainaccess into the house but the suspect eventually escaped.Consequently, the police equally rescued a one-year-old daughter ofthe complainant who was equally locked inside the house and leftcrying without care."To date, the suspect is still on the run and has not returned thecredentials he forcefully collected from the lady while aninvestigation is still ongoing."The command is wondering why the very person who allegedly assaulteda woman and deprived her of participating in the national youthservice will be the very person spreading the falsehood that policeassaulted a 98-year-old woman using AK-47 rifle which was totallyfalse and unfounded."
