Human rights lawyer, Femi Falana, has said that calls for a revolution in Nigeria is not new. Falana stated this at a symposium organised by the Coalition for Revolution, which held on Monday in Lagos. He said that Nigeria, which has the highest concentration of black people, must get things right, adding that “if we don't get it right, the black man is doomed”. The venue of the event, which was initially shut down by the police, was finally opened for the symposium after the arrival of Falana, who engaged and spoke with the security operatives. He said, “Let the authorities in Abuja know political leaders in this country have been calling for revolution and nobody arrested them. “So, if there is a mistake now that mistake must be corrected because as far as we are concerned this country belongs to all of us.

Now we are trying to gather in the hall, they said no but we are happy we have won and we will continue to win. “Revolution is not a dinner party, a revolution is a very serious, rigorous and consistent battle for the soul of the country. “The struggle is going be intense and there's no going back.  We do not have a revolution yet but there are revolutionary pressure and we must cease the opportunity and go out and mobilise the Nigerian people for the revolution and it is going to come sooner than we think.” Falana went on to call for the release of pro-democracy activist, Omoyele Sowore, who has so far spent 17 days in Department of State Services custody since his arrest on August 3.
