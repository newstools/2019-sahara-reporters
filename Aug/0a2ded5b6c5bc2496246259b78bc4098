  The Bible says, "knowledge is power". It also says "know the truth andit will set you free".This is made all the more important given the fact that history is nottaught in Nigerian schools.Let us join hands and walk down the beautiful path of knowledge,truth, and history together. Our focus and subject-matter for today isthe Fulani tribe of northern Nigeria.The Fulani are only partially African and only partly Negroid. Theyare the product of cross-breeding between the Taurags, Berbers, andArabs of north Africa on the one hand and the local black Africanwomen of Futa Jalon, Guinea in West Africa, on the other.In those days Futa Jalon was a popular trade route between north andwest Africa. After hundreds of years of cross-breeding the finalproduct of this union was the Fula race.If you doubt this assertion I challenge you to look at the texture oftheir hair, their thin lips, their slim and pointed noses, their talland slight build and their, more often than not, light complexion andyou will know that they are only partially African and only partlyNegroid.Like their Tutsi cousins (who also originally came from Futa Jalon butwho migrated to central and east Africa over the centuries) they areprimarily and in the main gypsy-like wanderers and nomads who aredeeply courageous and notoriously ruthless and ferocious in battle yetwho have a strange and inexplicable attachment to and affinity andaffection for their cattle and cows.They betray little emotion, even in the most difficult times and evenwhen going through immense and the most gruelling form of hardship andthey are focused, mentally-strong, disciplined, patient, calculating,proud, ruthless, wise and totally unforgiving.They have long memories: never forget a friend or favour and neverforgiving an insult or a slight. Most important of all is the factthat they overwhelm and conquer very slowly and incrementally and theydo so primarily by infiltration, assimilation, and guile.It is only when they are fully entrenched and empowered and when theyhave totally won the confidence of their host community andinfiltrated them that the sword is brought out and the most extremeforms of barbarity and violence are employed to achieve theirobjective.That is how they conquered the Habe Kingdom, subjugated the Hausa andturned them into vassals and that is how they took Ilorin from theYoruba Aare Ona Kakanfo, Afonja. In both cases, they dethroned andmurdered the sitting Kings that they had earlier befriended.Some historians have argued that they value the life of cows more thanthat of human beings. This may be true of the uneducated herdsmen andpastoralists amongst them but I do not believe it is entirely true oftheir traditional rulers and their educated and political elites.Some have also argued that their greatest desire is to establish ahomeland for themselves by grabbing the land of others because thereis nowhere in Africa that they can call their own.Even in Guinea where they originally came from they constitute a tinyminority of the population, they have never been trusted withpolitical power and they are viewed with the utmost suspicion.They arrived on the shores of what later became known as northernNigeria in 1804 when they launched their first jihad, under theleadership of Sheik Usman Dan Fodio, and conquered the Habe(Hausa-speaking) Kingdom of Gobir.That is how they got a foothold in Nigeria and they have been hereever since, imposing their Emirs over the local indigenous populationsall over the north in the name of Islam and turning the children ofthe conquered Hausa into almajiris.They constitute only 7% to 10% of the 200 million-strong Nigerianpopulation yet they wield and control more power and authority thanany other tribe or ethnic nationality in the country.This has been the case since Nigerian independence in 1960 by eitherholding power directly or wielding it through a series of spineless,cowardly, pliant, willing and loyal surrogates who do their biddingout of ignorance, fear and a pitiful inferiority complex and whoconsider them to be the "master race" that were ordained by God tolead Nigeria and that were "born to rule".Through Islam, they have conquered most of the core north because theEmir is not just an ethnic overlord but he is also the leader of theIslamic faithful in his domain.This is a powerful and dangerous mix of religion and ethnicity and itis one that the Fula's have used very effectively in their quest todominate, conquer and subjugate the whole of Nigeria and impose theirwill on the local indigenous tribes and populations that have beenthere for thousands of years before they came.Other than Usman Dan Fodio, two other Fulani leaders stand out as thecustodians and flagbearers of this messianic mission. The first of thetwo is Sir Ahmadu Bello, the erstwhile Saurdana of Sokoto and thepremier of the old Northern Region and the second is General MuhammaduBuhari, the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.It is for this reason that Usman Dan Fodio is often referred to as theFirst Mahdi of the north whilst Ahmadu Bello and Muhammadu Buhari arereferred to as the second and third Mahdi's of the north respectively.You can say what you want about the Fulani but one thing you cannottake from them is the fact that they fully understand and appreciatethe awesome power and beauty of ethnic and tribal unity in a widermulti-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-cultural nation like Nigeria.Despite all pretensions to the contrary and rather like the English ofthe United Kingdom, the Fulani will always put the Fulani interestbefore the Nigerian interest and this has served their tribal purposeand vision very well.That is a lesson that other Nigerian tribes and ethnic nationalitieswould do well to learn.Mr. Obadiah Mailafia, who is a former deputy governor of the CentralBank of Nigeria and a former presidential candidate from SouthernKaduna said the following on August 25, 2019, "Loyalty, honourrespect, integrity are defining features of the Yoruba leadershiptradition. Fulani leadership traditions are rooted in feudalism,pretence, hiding one's thoughts and taqquiya."The game plan is to exploit to the fullest the political andfinancial capital of Tinubu. They will keep him onside until they'reable to destroy him. To turn Nigeria into a Fulani Caliphate they willhappily sacrifice social progress for ambition. They understand thathungry desperate people would be too broken to raise their heads."To assist they continue to allow murderous and terrorist hordes fromCentral and Western Africa to take over ancestral lands by force. Theyare ruthlessly imposing total control over culture, mass media, publicadministration, and the economy. They govern by fear and are willingto plunge us into another civil war."I concur.Obadiah is an old friend of mine. He studied at Oxford University andhe is one of the brightest stars and most formidable intellectuals inNigeria today.Judging from his words he appears to know the Fulani very well indeed.I do too. How? Because even though I am a proud Yoruba man, mymaternal great grandmother was a full-blooded Fulani woman andconsequently 1/8 of the blood that runs through my veins is Fulani.I have never hidden this and I never will. As a matter of fact, I wearit as a badge of pride and honor because it proves that I cannotpossibly hate the Fulani because I cannot possibly hate myself.Criticism is different to hate. The former is healthy whilst thelatter is not. That is the point that many of my Fulani brothers andsisters fail to appreciate and find it difficult to comprehend.In any case, not all Fulani are bad and not all non-Fulani are good.What I hate are not the Fulani people but the callous, barbarous andunspeakable atrocities that the Fulani herdsmen and terrorists areperpetrating in my country and the racist, hegemonist, ethnic andreligious agenda that the Fulani leaders are seeking to impose.What is also clear to me is that the history, the disposition and theignoble intentions of the Fulani ruling elite raise concern and hasserious implications for the peace, welfare, and unity of Nigeria.If the Fulani do not retrace their steps, change their ways andmoderate their actions and if they do not reign in their vaultingambition of conquering the Nigerian space and becoming Nigeria's"master race", they can be rest assured of the fact that history,posterity and the Nigerian people will be very harsh on them.Worse still they may plunge our nation into a second savage, barbaricand fratricidal civil war which would make the first one look likechild's play and which would shatter the very foundations of the WestAfrican sub-region and tear the African continent apart. Let us praythat it never comes to that.This is the end of today's history lesson. Thanks for finding the timeto read and learn.
