The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has warned Nigerians that using substandard telecom devices could adversely affect their health. Prof. Umar Danbatta, NCC’s Executive Vice Chairman, said at a sensitisation workshop, 'Hazardous Effect of Non Type Approved Handsets and E-Waste: Impact on Quality of Service and E-Waste', for stakeholders that using substandard and counterfeit telecom devices was dangerous to human health and safety. He said substandard devices also increased cyber security-related threats such as 'Zero Day attack', adding that the NCC is working to evolve ways of curbing the menace of substandard and counterfeit devices. Danbattta further stated that using fake devices would have negative impacts on the quality of services given to telecom service consumers. “Using genuine handsets and other devices will help consumers to prevent economic losses and associated ailments. As a commission, we are not relenting in efforts to ensure that Nigeria is saved from the hazardous effects of using fake devices,” he explained. In a paper, 'The Socio-Economic Effects of Counterfeit Devices', Chukuma Nwaiwo of NCC’s Technical Standard and Network Integrity Department, said the proliferation of fake devices was having negative effects on Nigerians.
