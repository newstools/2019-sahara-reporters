NAN The Indigenous People of Biafra, the proscribed group demanding for a sovereign Biafra nation, said it has ordered its members to attack any Igbo leader, who visits 100 countries where it is located. In a statement, spokesperson for the organisation, Emma Powerful, said the directive to attack Igbo leaders was given by the IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu. Members of IPOB had on Saturday in Nuremberg, Germany, attacked former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, at an event to mark the New Yam Festival. Powerful said, “The Nuremberg IPOB family in Germany in keeping with the long-standing directive from our leader to hound all instigators of the Operation Python Dance, is glad to report that Ike Ekweremadu was confronted and duly hounded out of a so-called New Yam Festival event in Germany. “Despite repeated warnings to the organisers of this jamboree that Enugu, Ebonyi and other parts of ‘Biafraland’ is under siege by the Fulani caliphate and their collaborators within, they went ahead to invite a known traitor, co-conspirator and one of those who worked with Igbo governors to proscribe and tag IPOB a terror organisation while they never raised any voice against the murderous Fulani herdsmen. “This should serve as a warning to Nnia Nwodo, Dave Umahi, Okezie Ikpeazu, Willie Obiano and others that any day we find them in a public event abroad, they will be humiliated. “IPOB is strategically located in over 100 countries around the world. Anywhere we find them, they will be dealt with.”
