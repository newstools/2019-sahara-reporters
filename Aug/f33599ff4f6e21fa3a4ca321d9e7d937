 Thirteen members of the Vigilante Group of Nigeria in Adamawa have been killed and 20 others injured in crime fighting activities in the state over the past two months. Commander of the group in the state, Muhammadu Murtala, made the disclosure on Thursday in Yola, the capital. According to Murtala, the group’s members lost their lives in encounters with various criminal elements in the state including to Boko Haram insurgents. He said, “We have lost no fewer than 13 members with about 20 of our members injured in the course of fighting crimes across the state. “The sad thing is that majority of those killed lost their lives in the course of protecting the lives and property of other Nigerians. “Nobody is taking care or assisting the families and children of our members who lost their lives. “We are appealing to the government to assist us, including providing logistics because we don’t have a single vehicle for patrol.”
