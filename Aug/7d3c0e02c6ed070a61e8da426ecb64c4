He made the plea on Wednesday in Sokoto, the capital, when he received the European Union Ambassador and Head of delegation to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Mr Ketil Karsen, in Government House.

The governor further said that the process would give legal framework that would go along in strengthening and deepening the nation’s democracy. He said, “As a matter of urgency, NASS should consider starting the process of electoral reforms and constitutional amendments in the interest of the nation.” In his remarks, Karsen called for peace and respect for the rule of law in the state and Nigeria in general, as according to him that was going to create the atmosphere needed for electoral reforms to thrive.
