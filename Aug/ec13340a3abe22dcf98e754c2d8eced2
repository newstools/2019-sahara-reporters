A survey by market research group, Global Web Index, has said that Nigeria ranks only second behind Philippines for countries whose citizens spend the most time on the social media. The organisation surveyed 46 countries, discovering that Nigeria’s youthful population are on social media for an average of three hours and 30 minutes, according to a report by The Cable. The research attributes the likely reasons for the high social media presence to the youthful nature of the population and unemployment. It notes that Nigerians have used different networking platforms on the web to sell commodities such as shoes, clothing, and to promote activities like dancing and comedy. On the other hand, countries like Japan, spend only 45 minutes on networking platforms due to its ageing population. The survey found that citizens of Russia, India, and China spend over two hours on social media daily, while those in the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, France, and Germany spend over an hour. Residents of the Philippines stay on social media sites for up to 4 hours and one minute however. The research was conducted across platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook Messenger,LinkedIn, Skype, Snapchat, Instagram, YouTube, Pinterest, among others. The research also found out that social media usage shrunk in the first quarter of 2018 when compared with the same period the previous year.
