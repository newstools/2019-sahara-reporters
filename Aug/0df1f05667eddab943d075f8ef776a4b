BBC After the successful test of the new drugs discovered to cure the Ebola virus in the Democratic Republic of Congo, two people cured of the virus have reunited with their families. The two people cured were released from the treatment centre in Goma, eastern DR Congo. They were cured using the newly discovered drugs REGN-EB3 and mAb114, BBC reports. According to researchers, more than 90 per cent of infected people can survive if treated early with REGN-EB3 and mAb114. Two other treatments, called ZMapp and Remdesivir, have been dropped from trials as they were found to be less effective. The survivors had been among a group of four diagnosed in Goma, the largest city affected by the outbreak that has so far killed at least 1,800 people. The two others in that group have since died. Scientists, however, are hopeful that Ebola may soon be a preventable and treatable disease after promising clinical trials of two drugs, which, according to expert Dr Sabue Mulangu, saw 60 per cent of the 681 patients survive.
