IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu A Nigerian, Donald Okonkwo, has filed a lawsuit praying a federal high court in Abuja to compel the British High Commission to arrest and repatriate the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, to Nigeria.The suit was filed on Monday.The UK embassy in Nigeria, the Director-General of the Department of State Services (DSS) and the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, are the respondents to the suit.Okonkwo alleged that violent activities of Kanu and other IPOB members which included the recent attack on Senator Ike Ekweremadu in Germany, and the threat by the group to attack President Muhammadu Buhari in Japan were creating fears in the minds of Nigerians.He, therefore, urged the court to declare that the UK embassy in Nigeria “is under obligation to repatriate the IPOB separatist leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.”
