  Olawale Adebayo, a young man, who joined the #RevolutionNow protest in Osogbo, Osun State, is still in custody of the Department of State Services, 20 days after he was arrested. A source, who spoke to Sahara Reporters, said after Adebayo's arrest in Osogbo, he was transferred to Abuja by men of the DSS and has been held incommunicado since then. Sahara Reporters also gathered that Adebayo’s relatives and friends have been barred from having access to him. The DSS in Abuja could not be reached for comments as at the time of filing this report.
