 The Nigeria Football Federation says it is reviewing the life ban imposed on Samson Siasia by the world football governing body, FIFA, while waiting to take action after seeking legal advice. FIFA had on Friday announced the ban of Siasia, former Super Eagles coach, from any footballing activities both national and international after being found guilty of bribery and match-fixing. The NFF described the life ban as a “massive sanction", adding that it is shocked by the decision of the FIFA Ethics Committee. Acting President of NFF, Barrister Seyi Akinwunmi, in a statement, said, “The NFF was shocked to learn of the investigation and the subsequent decision by the FIFA Ethics Committee (Adjudicatory Chamber) placing a life ban on Mr. Samson Siasia. But we have, however, now received documents, including one known as the 'motivated decision', and we have handed them to our lawyers to study and provide legal advice to the Federation.

3 Days Ago “It is a massive sanction on one of our legends. Siasia is a football legend but most importantly he is a Nigerian. We must, therefore, be interested in the matter and be properly advised.” He added, “While we respect the FIFA processes and appreciate that an investigation was conducted prior to the decision, the least we as a Federation can do is empathize with him at this time, make ourselves available to him and hope that in some way he is able to clear his name as he has promised to do.”
