 The Federal High Court in Abuja will on Wednesday hear the motion filed by the Islamic Movement in Nigeria challenging the ex-parte order prescribing its activities in the country. The IMN, in aÂ  motion filed on August 2 by its lawyer, Femi Falana, had sought the court to vacate the order made on July 26 outlawing the existence of the group. Justice Nkeonye Maha is expected to hear the case. The court had, upon an ex-parte motion by the office of the Attorney-General of the Federation also declared the group a terrorist organisation. Recall that the Federal Government had on July 29 published the order in its official gazette as directed by the court.
