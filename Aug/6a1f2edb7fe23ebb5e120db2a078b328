President Muhammadu Buhari has urged Nigerian Muslims to avoid extremist ideas and pursue peace.In his Sallah message, Buhari said, “Extremism is like cancer, which must be detected and destroyed from its early stages of growth.“We should be the mirror through which others see the good virtues of our faith.“Islam is a religion of peace and we should avoid violent extremist ideas that give Islam a wrong name because our conducts leave more lasting positive impressions than what we say by word of mouth.”President Buhari admitted that violent extremism was the greatest challenge facing Islam and the only way to deal with the situation is for Muslims to abstain from activities and teachings of those who preach indiscriminate violence against innocent people.According to Buhari, Boko Haram became a terror group because Muslim societies were indifferent to the activities of extremist preachers.
