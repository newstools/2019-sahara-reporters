A federal high court in Abuja on Monday refused to grant a request stopping President Muhammadu Buhari from inaugurating the 43 ministerial nominees over the exclusion of a Federal Capital Territory's indigene from his cabinet list. The applicant, Mr. Musa Baba-Panya, who was also the counsel in the case, had on Thursday, approached the court with an ex parte motion, asking the court to stop the President Buhari from going ahead with the inauguration. In suit number: number: FHC/ABJ/CS/878/19, Baba-Panya, who is also an indigene of Karu in the FCT, said the president’s action was contrary to an appeal court’s judgment delivered on March 15, 2018. Buhari was the first defendant while the attorney general of the federation was the second defendant in the case. The president would be inaugurating the 43 ministers-designate earlier confirmed by the Senate on August 21 at the Federal Executive Council Chamber, Presidential Villa, Abuja. Baba-Panya, who argued that the appeal court’s ruling was a compelling order, said it was served on the president through the attorney general. The lawyer, in an originating summons dated August 7 and filed August 8, said, ”The 43 confirmed ministerial appointees now awaiting swearing-in or inauguration as the Federal Executive Council is incomplete, illegal, unconstitutional, null, void and of no effect whatsoever.” Justice Taiwo Taiwo, however, noted that the suit was coming rather too late and therefore there might be no reason to stop the inauguration.
