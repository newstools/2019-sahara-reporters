According to him, Falana unlawfully threatened to kill Olaiya with a knife. The defendant was also of causing a breach of peace, which made him to commit an offence contrary to  Section 86 (2) of the Criminal Code, Cap C 16, Laws of Ekiti State, 2012. However, Falana pleaded not guilty to the offences. His lawyer, Peter Oluwanisola, therefore urged the court to grant him bail. Oluwanisola promised that his client would not jump bail, promising that Falana would always make himself available for trial. The Chief Magistrate, Aderopo Adegboye, granted the defendant bail in the sum of N200,000 with two sureties in like sum. The chief magistrate adjourned the case until September 18 for further hearing.
