Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) members Nigerian university workers have said that they would embark on a warning strike from Monday until their demand to the government is met. The planned one-week strike, which will last from August 19 to 23, is coming four months after the Academic Staff Union of Nigerian Universities suspended their two-month strike. In a letter on Friday, the non-academic unions comprising the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities and Non-Academic Staff Union of Universities, said, “At the expiration of the 14-day ultimatum on August 18, 2019 without a positive response from the Federal Government of Nigeria, members shall proceed on a five-day warning strike in all branches from Monday 19 to Friday 23 August 2019.” The unions said the contending issues include payment of earned allowances, university staff schools matter, renegotiation of 2019 FGN/unions agreement among others. It therefore directed all members to comply with the action or face sanctions. The letter further said, “You are therefore directed to properly mobilise our members for this action. All defaulting branches shall be sanctioned accordingly. Please be guided.” Recall that the unions embarked on a nationwide strike on December 4, 2017 following the failure of the government to address their grievances, however, it was suspended in March 2018.
