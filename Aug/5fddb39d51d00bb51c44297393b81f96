The unions including National Union of Air Transport Employees, Air Transport Services Senior Staff Association of Nigeria, Association of Nigeria Aviation Professionals and the Amalgamated Union of Public Corporations Civil Service Technical and Recreational Services Employees in a communiqué issued at the end of an emergency meeting in Lagos, said they would give the management of the agency till end of August to produce the conditions of service. The communiqué expressed disappointment that the new approved condition of service had been delayed. They noted that the unions, management, National Income, Salaries, Wages Commission and Federal Ministry of Transport representatives met last week in Abuja and concluded all amendments as requested by the commission. According to them, the management of NAMA was expected to provide the new approved conditions of service on or before August 31, 2019.
