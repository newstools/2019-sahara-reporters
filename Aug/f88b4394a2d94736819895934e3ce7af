Gunmen from an IS-affiliated jihadist group on Tuesday shot dead 11local construction workers in the North-East, a militia leader andresident said.The fighters belonging to Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP)opened fire on the workers as they were laying telecom fibre opticcables in Wajirko village, 150 kilometres (93 miles) outside Bornostate capital Maiduguri, they said."The insurgents came in the morning and opened fire on the workers,killing 11 and injuring many," militia leader Mustapha Karimbe toldAgence France Presse.He said the victims were locals contracted as casual labourers by atelecom firm."The attackers had warned the labourers to stop working on laying thecables but they ignored the warning because they needed money to feedtheir families," Karimbe said from the town of Biu, 50 km away.Those injured were taken to a hospital in the nearby town of Damboa, he said.The jihadists "came around" on three separate occasions and warned themen to stop the work which the group saw as a threat, said residentBukar Maduye."Our people are starving and the laying of the cables provides some ofus a good source of income which was why we ignored the warning," saidMaduye, who gave the same toll.ISWAP is known to have a strong presence in Wajirko and neighbouringareas although it is close to Sambisa forest, the major enclave ofrival Boko Haram jihadists.The IS-supported jihadists have carried out several attacks targetingNigerian troops in the area.In April, the militants looted and burnt a military base in Wajirko,after fierce fighting with soldiers who were forced to withdraw.Since then, troops have abandoned the base and the village was leftwithout protection save snap military patrols which are prone tojihadist attacks.In June, three soldiers were killed in an ISWAP ambush on a militarypatrol near the village.ISWAP split from Boko Haram in 2016 over ideological differences andthe latter's indiscriminate attacks on civilians.ISWAP focuses its attacks on military targets.However, the group has in recent months been accused of raidingvillages and looting food supplies.The killing of the construction workers could be the group's firstsuch attack on civilians and it was unclear if it was an isolated caseor a shift in tactics.The decade-long violence which has spilled into neighbouring Niger,Chad, and Cameroon, has killed 35,000 people and displaced about twomillion in Nigeria alone, prompting a regional military coalition tofight the jihadist groups, reports AFP.
