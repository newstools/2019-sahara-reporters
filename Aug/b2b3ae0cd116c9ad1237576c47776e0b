It’s like the era of these 419ners and 'Yahoo Boys' is coming back.“I remember we worked with the FBI in Lagos and others. We carried out 'Operation Wire Wire'. We are re-energizing; we will go out and storm all their hideouts. Most of them have relocated to Ghana because the heat is on them.”He pledged the readiness of the commission to sustain the ongoing collaboration with relevant agencies, with a view to curbing the menace of cybercrimes.
