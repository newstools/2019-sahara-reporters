A human rights activist, Ugagaoghene Ogheneyole, who was arrested on August 5, 2019 by operatives of the Department of State Services for participating in the #Revolutionnow protest, is still being held in detention by the secret police in Delta State. Making the disclosure in a chat with Sahara Reporters, Founder of Behind Bar Rights Initiative, Harrison Gwamnishu, said that Ogheneyole is yet to be released despite earlier assurances given by a top official of the DSS that he would be freed. Also condemning the activist’s continued detention, President of Isoko National Youths Assembly, Umuakpo Ovie, called for his immediate and unconditional release. He said, “I have been informed that our brother Ugagaoghene Ogheneyole is still in DSS detention over the revolution now protest. “We collectively call for his immediate release. “His pregnant wife hasn't been allowed to see him in detention. This is not good and we call for his immediate release.”
