An official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has informed TheCable that four of the people, who attacked former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, in Nuremberg, Germany, last weekend during a ceremony organised by Ndi-Igbo, have been identified. The source said they were figured out following an analysis of a viral video showing the incident. The official said, “I cannot reveal their identities for now because the German authorities are now co-operating with us and investigating the attack.” It was learnt that Nigerian Ambassador to Germany, Yusuf Tuggar, pressured a reluctant Bavarian police to look into the incident. Tuggar had impressed on the authorities that under section 102 (1) Chapter 3 of the German Criminal Code, attacks against heads of foreign governments or representatives of organs of foreign governments were punishable.
