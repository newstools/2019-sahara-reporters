This is unacceptable!”  Marvix added, “The day rogue policemen or soldiers do you strong thing you will come here with your hashtag telling them to answer Nigerians questions. So the life that was cut short by the police means nothing to you, go ahead and prosecute them, your day will soon come!” Chief of Port Harcourt said, “Death means nothing to you again, we no. Just arrest all the tankers drivers you are very good at that. Arrest them all.”DEJI said, “What a comedian Governor. So d life of the driver allegedly killed by police doesn't matter?? Zero leadership.”Oche Ameh noted, “Protesting for justice is a crime but killing an unarmed citizen by a Corp is something to b silent about right? Dis is d type of government we have.”Adams Splendor explained, “But your sense of justice does not deem it fit to arrest and prosecute the policemen responsible for the driver's life that was wasted nor for the brazen display of corruption,harassment and intimidation of commuters along that route. What a travesty of justice. Pathetic.”Tunlapa said, “The drivers??  But you heard what he said, a driver was just gunned down and you are arresting the drivers. What is really the problem with you leaders? that life doesn't matter to you at all.”
