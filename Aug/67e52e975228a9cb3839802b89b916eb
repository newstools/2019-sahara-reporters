Arguments ensued between the two which led to an exchange of blows. “Friends of the two joined in the fight in solidarity and other miscreants took advantage of the moment to steal and loot. “They blocked Lagos/Abeokuta Expressway. What started as a fight between two miscreants almost snowballed into ethnic crisis, if not for the timely intervention of the police.
