Air Commodore Yusuf Anas (retd.), a former spokesperson for the Nigerian Air Force has condemned the chaotic handling of the killings of three police officers by soldiers in Taraba State.Air Commodore Anas who spoke in Abuja on Monday noted that the matter could have been better managed as it affected the image of the two security agencies involved.He cited the lack of “strategic communication mechanism”.According to him, the absence of proper coordination made the matter to degenerate and became a matter of public discussion.Speaking further, he urged security agencies to avoid matters that will further denigrate the image of the country.“When security agencies institutions come out in public and begin to trade blames and scathing counter-accusations over an unfortunate incident, when they are actually supposed to work in synergy and mutual collaboration,” Anas stated.He added, “Both the army and police are critical agencies saddled with the responsibility of providing maximum security for teeming Nigerians and the country itself.“Thus, they should eschew acts that not only smear their institutional reputations but that of the nation at large.”
