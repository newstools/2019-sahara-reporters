She said, “From January to July, 2019, about 330 attacks were recorded, resulting in the deaths of about 1,460 civilians. “However, between June and July, 2019, the number of incidents declined, especially in Zamfara State, that had been the epicentre of armed banditry. “The Federal Government is doing a lot to improve border security with a view to addressing some of these challenges.”
