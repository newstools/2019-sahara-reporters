After a failed attempt by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to search the home of immediate-past governor of Lagos State, Akinwunmi Ambode, the stateâ€™s House of Assembly has set up a committee to probe him. The committee will be chaired by Fatai Mojeed and one of its mandates will be to investigate the purchase of 820 buses meant for public transport but which never grazed the roads.
