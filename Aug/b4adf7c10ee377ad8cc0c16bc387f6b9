The Media Rights Agenda has condemned the arrest and continuous detention of Mr Ibrahim Dan-Halilu, a journalist and former Politics Editor of Daily Trust newspaper, by operatives of the Department of State Services. MRA’s Executive Director, Mr Edetaen Ojo, in a statement, argued that the DSS had no grounds to keep Dan-Halilu, calling for his immediate and unconditional release from custody. He also argued that the actions of the intelligence agency amounted to a breach of the constitution and Nigeria. He said, “It is now over one week since Mr Dan-Halilu was arrested and continues to be held in unlawful and unconstitutional detention as no charges have been filed against him nor has he been arraigned before any court of law as required by Section 35(4) and (5) of the constitution.
