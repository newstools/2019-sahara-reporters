2 Days Ago In a statement sent to Sahara Reporters by the institution’s Director of Radio and Public Relations, Prof Danjuma Gambo, the university said, “For the avoidance of doubt, neither Dr Nura nor the organisation that reportedly gave him the said award has officially contacted the university management with credible information on the matter.” Recall that Dr Nura was reported on Friday to have won a “world physics championship” award. The 51-year-old mid-level cadre lecturer was said to have been crowned the “Father of modern Einstein’s Planetary Equation studies in Physics”. Danjuma however, said; “The university will do the needful whenever it receives official, verifiable information from impeccable sources in order to put the matter into proper perspective.” (function(){
