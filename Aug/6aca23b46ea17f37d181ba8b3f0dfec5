Youths of Mkpu-Nando in the Anambra East Local Government Area ofAnambra State, on Tuesday, staged a protest against their monarch,Igwe Alex Edozieuno, over the alleged misappropriation of N150m landproceeds belonging to the community.Displaying placards with various inscriptions, the youth and womenasked the monarch to produce the missing money to avoid further rage.Some of the inscriptions on the placards read, ‘He must refund ourmoney’, ‘We don’t need this kind of monarch again’, ‘This Igwe shouldbe arrested and prosecuted’, ‘Governor Willie Obiano come and rescue’,Punch reports.They marched on the Ama Umuawulu village square and other roads in thecommunity, including the frontage of the monarch’s palace singinguncomplimentary songs about the Igwe.Security operatives, however, prevented the crowd of about 400persons, from entering the monarch’s compound.The leader of the protesters, Ifeanyi Iloakasia, a lawyer, said thestate government should order the monarch to refund the money to thecommunity.He said the N150 million was the compensation the state governmentpaid to the community for acquiring land in the community.“If the government fails to intervene and retrieve the money fromIgwe, we will not have any option but to resort to self-help.“The monarch and the estate valuer are in an unholy alliance to ripoff the Mkpunando community and we will not allow this to happen inour place.“The total money paid to the community by the government was N150m,while the commission was N15 million for the facilitators and tilldate, we have not received anything from the Igwe,” Iloakasiaexplained.However, Edozieuno told Punch that the protesters were liars, addingthat he did not owe anybody or group.According to him, the main issue for the protesters’ action was notthe money, but because he defeated the family of the initiators duringthe kingship contest.He said, “Since then, some of them have refused to give up. They knowthat I am a rich man that I have no reason to touch their money. Imade money when I was 20 years old and bought my first car at that agealso. Their allegations hold no water.”
