 The National Assembly Election Petitions Tribunal in Adamawa State has affirmed the election of Ishaku Abbo representing Adamawa North Senatorial district at the federal legislature. The tribunal delivered judgement on the case in Yola, the state capital, on Thursday and dismissed the case on grounds of inability of the petitioner to prove her case. Binta Garba and the All Progressives Congress had based their petition on claims of over-voting, non-use of card readers and other instances of 'noncompliance with the Electoral Act.' She, therefore, prayed the tribunal to void Abbo's election and to conduct supplementary election in polling units where alleged infractions took place. The respondents, Abbo and the Peoples Democratic Party, however, countered the petition, saying the election, which produced Abbo was conducted in substantial compliance with the Electoral Act. Delivering the judgement, Chairman of the tribunal, Justice Suleiman Akanbi, said the petitioner failed to produce concrete evidence to back her allegations. He said, “The witnesses did not help the case. The petitioner fell short of Section 181 of the Evidence Act which requires a petitioner to provide convincing proof. “He who alleges must provide proof.” Reacting to the judgement, counsel to Garba said his client will appeal the judgment.
