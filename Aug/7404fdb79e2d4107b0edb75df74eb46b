A man, David Okotie, was on Wednesday remanded in the prison by an Ikeja Chief Magistrate’s Court in Lagos for allegedly raping an 11-year-old girl. Chief Magistrate Olufunke Sule-Amzat made the order following an application by the police. According to The Nation, Sule-Amzat, who did not take Okotie’s plea, remanded Okotie in Kirikiri Prison's custody and ordered the police to send the case file to the director of public prosecutions for advice. Prosecution counsel, Benson Emuerhi, who made the application, alleged that Okotie, who lives off Highway Patrol Barrack, Ikeja, Lagos, committed the offence on January 15. The court heard that the case was reported by the girl’s mother at the Gender Section, Ikeja Police Command. Emuerhi, an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), said the offence violated Section 137 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015. Sule-Amzat adjourned further proceedings until October 31.
