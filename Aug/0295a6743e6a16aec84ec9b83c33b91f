Borno State Governor, Babagana Zulum, has donated a part of  Sambisa forest,  Boko Haram’s stronghold, to the President Muhammadu Buhari government for the Rural Grazing Area (RUGA) programme. The initiative was suspended following vehement opposition to it by the South and the Middle-Belt geopolitical zones. According to TheCable, Zulum announced the donation when the Shehu of Borno, Alhaji Garbai El-Kanemi, visited him at Government House, Maiduguri, during Sallah celebration. He said the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, agro rangers and hunters had been mobilized to secure the area. Zulum said, “We have identified six different locations we consider safe for the pilot scheme in the state. The RUGA scheme is as old as history; it is not a new thing. I don’t know why some people are politicizing it. “This administration is determined to strengthen the security architecture to encourage farming and herding activities across the state.” The governor said the government would provide  80 patrol vehicles to boost security in the state. Zulum added, “About 75 trained agro rangers and 300 hunters will also be mobilized next week to enable farmers to cultivate their farmlands. “The state government is determined to address the root causes of insurgency through improved security, fight against drug abuse and enhance food security with increase job creation for  youths.” Meanwhile, Zulum has said the recent Boko Haram attacks on Gajiram, Gajigana, Dalori, and Gubio will not discourage the people. He said his government was more committed than ever before to take on the insurgents and ensure peace in the state. The governor stated this on Wednesday during the official launch of the NSCDC Agro Rangers Squad. The Assistant Commandant General of NSCDC, Augustine Obiekwe, who represented the commandant general of the corps, said agro rangers would be deployed all over the country to protect the agricultural resources.
