President Muhammadu Buhari
gettyimages Despite promises by President Muhammadu Buhari, the government is yet to pay 22 months salary arrears to workers of the Ministry of Education. Speaking with Sahara Reporters, a top official in the ministry stated that when President Buhari came into office in 2015, he gave a directive to all MDAs to clear all outstanding salary arrears, and promotion arrears but up till date, the salary arrears are yet to be paid to those being owed by the government since 2013. The official said, “I am one of the officers who are supposed to be paid for long but our issue have been forgotten, and we have been abandoned in Niger State. “The government is owing us 22 months salary arrears in the Ministry of Education.” When asked if other ministries had been paid, the top official added, “Since President Buhari gave the instructions to all MDAs to clear all outstanding salary arrears, and promotion arrears about three years ago, some MDAs have settled theirs but Federal Ministry of Education which is supposed to be a role model for other ministries has failed to pay its officers their salary arrears.”
