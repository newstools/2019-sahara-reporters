Fearing that the President Muhammadu Buhari regime would subject them to torture and dehumanizing conditions under indefinite detention in underground cells of the department of State Services (DSS), the Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) has advised Germany not to extradite the alleged attackers of the Senator Ike Ekweremadu to Nigeria.HURIWA stated that any attempts by the German government to accede to Buhari's demand to extradite the alleged attackers "to face uncertainty would amount to the breach of international human rights laws".The group reminded the German authorities that Buhari "treats court's decisions with a disdain which means that he will inevitably subject those citizens to extralegal punishments".HURIWA's argument was contained in a statement by its National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko and the National Media Affairs Director, Zainab Yusuf, which was released today (Saturday).
