A 42-year-old driver, Sulaimon Ajigbot Allah, has been remanded in prison custody by a Magistrate court in Oyo State for allegedly defiling his nine-year-old daughter. Chief Magistrate O.O Adisa of an Iyaganku Magistrates’ Court on Monday ordered that Allah be remanded in prison pending legal advice. Adisa, who refused to accept the appeal of the driver, gave the police an order to send the copy of the case file to the Oyo State Directorate of Public Prosecution for legal advice. The case was adjourned until September 27 for mention, according to the News Agency of Nigeria. The offence was said to have contravened the provisions of Section 218 of the Criminal Code Cap 38, Vol II, Laws of Oyo State 2000.
