The Human Rights Writers Association has called on the Nigeria Police Force to account for 500 paraded suspected armed Fulani bandits, kidnappers and other armed hoodlums arrested at the beginning of the year. The group wondered why hoodlums are frequently paraded while no prosecutions or convictions are heard of thereafter. In a statement on Monday, HURIWA said, “It is inconceivable that the offices of the Inspector-General of Police and the Attorney-General of the Federation will allow the Zamfara State governor to embark on negotiated settlements with armed Fulani bandits who are responsible for some 3,000 mass murders instead of bringing these culprits to face justice in accordance with the law. “There is the urgency for the top hierarchy of the Nigeria Police Force to transparently render accounts publicly and open up the books and detention facilities to the National Human Rights Commission and credible civil rights advocacy groups all across the country to verify the exact situation concerning the progress of prosecution or otherwise of the well over 500 paraded suspected armed Fulani bandits and kidnappers.”
