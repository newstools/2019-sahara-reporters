Unknown gunmen Some gunmen have attacked and abducted the Chief Medical Director of Irrua Specialist Hospital, Edo State, Prof Sylvanus Okogbenin. The hoodlums also killed two policemen detailed to him in the process. The incident is coming after a similar attack last week where two assistant directors of the hospital were abducted and released after payment of ransom. Two other persons in the convoy whose identities were yet to be ascertained were shot in the leg. An eyewitness told PUNCH that the gunmen abducted Okogbenin after killing the policemen.

Chairman of Senior Staff Association of Universities Teaching Hospital Research Institute and Associated Institutions of Nigeria, Irrua branch, Emmanuel Igiechi, said the union would protest against insecurity in the area, adding that the abduction showed that workers at the hospital were being monitored. Igiechi said, “This tells us how serious the security situation has become. It is a very dire situation we are in. “The security agencies should strengthen their presence in Irrua and environs.”
