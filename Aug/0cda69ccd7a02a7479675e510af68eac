The management of Medanta Hospital in New Delhi, India, has yielded to the demands of the leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, by allowing the doctors he initially had an appointment with to attend to his failing health. SaharaReporters had reported that El-Zakzaky could soon return to Nigeria after being given a two-hour ultimatum by the Indian Government to leave the country for refusing to be treated by unknown doctors at the hospital on Wednesday. A top member of the Islamic Human Right Commission in London, who spoke with Sahara Reporters, disclosed that the management of the Indian hospital had agreed to commence treatment of the IMN leader with doctors he had initially booked an appointment with.
