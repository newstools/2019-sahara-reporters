A 30-year-old Headteacher of a private school in the Kuje area of Abuja has been arrested by the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons for allegedly raping a six-year-old pupil of the school. Identified as Shedrach Nwekeagu, the suspect allegedly started by inserting a finger into the minor’s private part before raping her a week later. The man was said to have been arrested after the victim opened up to her father after he noticed blood stains on her underwear. Head of Press and Public Relations Unit of NAPTIP, Stella Nezan, confirmed the arrest in a statement on Thursday. The statement read, “Operatives of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons have arrested 30 years old Shedrach Nwekeagu for allegedly raping a six-year-old school pupil. “The suspect is the Headteacher in one of the private schools in the Kuje Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory. “According to the victim’s father who reported the matter to NAPTIP, he observed that his daughter complained of stomach ache and saw bloodstains on her underwear. “Upon enquiry, she informed her parents that Nwekeagu had inserted his finger into her vagina the previous week, and a week later, brutally raped her in a classroom after school hours while they waited to be picked up by their parents. “Some teachers in the school also informed NAPTIP that they had their suspicions about Nwekeagu sexually molesting pupils in the school but were afraid of speaking out because the suspect was a relative of the owner of the School. “NAPTIP condemns the alleged rape, and promises that the suspect is going to be thoroughly prosecuted.”
