 A customary court in Lagos has dissolved a 35-year-old marriage between Abolore Lawal and his wife, Shakirat for defamation. The petitioner, Lawal said his wife called him a thief. Delivering judgment, the President of the Court, Adeniyi Koledoye, said: “It appears that the estranged couple are tired of the marriage. “The respondent did not appear in court in person to defend the accusations raised by the petitioner. “It is sad that the marriage that has produced young children in which the couple should be enjoying with their grandchildren now found displeasure in each other. “Since both parties consented to the dissolution of their marriage, this court has no choice but to dissolve the marriage. “The court hereby pronounces the marriage between Rahman Lawal and Shakirat, dissolved today, both of you henceforth cease to be husband and wife. “Each of you should go on his or her separate ways unmolested, the court wishes both of you well in your future endeavour.” The aggrieved petitioner told the court: “She accused me of embezzling money meant for payment of arrears and promotion, which was not true. “I have never been unfaithful to my wife but she keeps accusing me of extra-marital affairs.” Shakirat was not in court to defend the allegation.
