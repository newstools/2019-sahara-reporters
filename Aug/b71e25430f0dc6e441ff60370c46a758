 The Nigerian Army may rotate its troop in Taraba, Adamawa and other adjourning states, Punch reports. According to the newspaper's sources, the army authorities took the decision because they felt some soldiers might have been compromised or that some troops might have been infiltrated by criminal elements. One of the sources said, “The army headquarters may rotate most of the troops and officers in Taraba and adjourning states when the dust has settled. That is one of the suggestions because there seems to be much infiltration of the personnel by criminals.” A top military source also said the army headquarters was considering the rotation of most of the troops in Taraba State, as the allegations of conniving with criminals on the part of the soldiers continued. Also, the seven-man investigative panel constituted by the Defence Headquarters, Abuja, at the instance of  President Muhammadu Buhari to probe the killing of three policemen in Taraba, had visited the area and questioned soldiers and officers.
