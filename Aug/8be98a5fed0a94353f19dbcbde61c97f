Nigeria’s Helen ‘Iron Lady’ Joseph is set for action against Martina Horgasx from Hungary on Thursday in her return to professional boxing. The super-bantamweight fight holding in Connecticut, United States, is the second for the 30-year-old after a one-year competition drought occasioned by lack of sponsorship. On April 3, Joseph ended the one-year break by defeating Edina Kiss, another Hungarian, by unanimous decision in a six-round fight in New York. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the path to Thursday was rocky for the talented US-based boxer, who had to buy the fight. This means that with promoters and sponsors still nowhere to be found, she had to personally raise the $10,000 demanded by organisers to give her an opponent. This she did through the sale of tickets with the assistance of the Nigerian Consulate in New York. Also nicknamed “Princess of Africa”, Jospeh’s 15-year career boasts of an impressive 21-fight record of 16 wins, including 10 knockouts; two draws, and three “unjust” defeats.
