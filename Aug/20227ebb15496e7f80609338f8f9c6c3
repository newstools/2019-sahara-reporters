The Department of Security Services has released ex-Daily Trust editor, Mr Ibrahim Dan-Halilu, after 11 days in custody. Dan-Halilu was arrested over a Facebook post endorsing the #RevolutionNowprotest spearheaded by Omoyele Sowore. The DSS released the journalist on Friday, according to PRNigeria. Dan-Halilu, after a preliminary investigation, was released penultimate Wednesday but was again re-arrested after operatives of DSS in Kaduna received a directive from Abuja that he should be made to undergo further thorough investigation and 'rigorous' questioning. A family source also confirmed the release of Dan-Halilu to PRNigeria.
