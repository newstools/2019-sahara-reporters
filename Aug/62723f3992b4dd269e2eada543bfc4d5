 The Magistrate Court in Umuahia, Abia State, has remanded Ajayi Johnson, the soldier, who killed Chimaobi Nwaorgu, a commercial cyclist, over N100 bribe. Presiding Magistrate, Linda Ugboaja, remanded the dismissed soldier and adjourned the case for lack of jurisdiction. The soldier was dismissed by the Nigerian Army after the killing of Nwaorgu was reported in the media. The Army claimed that Johnson was away without official leave. He was handed over to the police for proper prosecution after he was cross-marshalled. Spokesperson for the Abia State Police Command, Geoffrey Ogbonna, said the case would be transferred to the high court where murder cases are prosecuted. He said, “The case has been adjourned till September 16 to enable the police to transfer the file to the appropriate quarters.”
