The National Council of Women Societies (NCWS) and the Nigerian government have condemned the sexual content on Big Brother Naija (BBN), a reality TV show, stating that it is not a Nigerian culture. Segun Runsewe, Director-General of the National Council for Arts and Culture (NCAC), said this while receiving Gloria Shoda, President of the National Council of Women Societies (NCWS). The NCAC boss also revealed that the government was in talks with Startimes to start a state-owned BBN that will truly reflect Nigerian content. He also warned that the agency would present a nudity bill to punish sexual acts as displayed on BBN. He said: “We are going to re-present that bill. You can’t fight a battle without a legal framework; we are definitely going to be conscious of that. “I will take up the issue of Big Brother Naija. I have spoken with officials of the National Broadcasting Commission because what is going on now is terrible. Having love affairs on the screen is not part of our own culture at all. “Let me use this forum to tell Nigerians that a new Big Brother Naija is on its way coming and we are working with Startimes. We are doing BBN that will reflect the true Nigerian culture. We are already working on it, all that will be eaten there will be Nigerian food, the dresses will be Nigerian dresses.” The NCWS president said she was not against the BBN reality show but the sex content was disgusting. Shoda said, “Having live sex on stage is the thing affecting my sensibility and it is impacting negatively on the young children coming up. Does it mean that they can’t abstain from sex for three months? I’m condemning the sex content on BBN.”
