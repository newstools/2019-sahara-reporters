John Moore/Getty Images Authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo have confirmed a new case of Ebola in the remote territory of Walikale, according to a report by Reuters. Walikale is hundreds of kilometres away from where previous cases near the border with Uganda and Rwanda occurred. Pinga, the village where the case was reported, lies about 150km northwest of Goma, one of the towns affected by the Ebola epidemic and much further away from the epicentre of the dieses in Butembo and Beni. The country’s Ministry of Health data also showed a third case confirmed in South Kivu region, which on Friday reported its first cases. The widening geographic spread of the virus and its presence in yet another zone under the sway of armed groups, raises the risk of it spreading out of control even while the technical tools to rein it in are better than ever. Ebola has killed at least 1,900 people in Congo over the past year, the second biggest toll in the disease’s history, after 2014, when 16 outbreaks in West Africa killed 11,300 people.
