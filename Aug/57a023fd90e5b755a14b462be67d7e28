Adeniyi revealed that four vehicles conveying insurgents’ fishery products were seized on Maiduguri-Ngala Road by operatives of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps.According to him, the military has not moved out of Borno State but changed its strategies to prevent attacks on its base.He added that troops had vacated the trenches and reduced the roadblocks and in its stead, evolved mobile units where the troops rove troubled areas.He said the military found out that the stationed formation made it easy for the insurgents to attack military facilities but with the latest strategy, he pointed out, the insurgents would be in for a surprise.He said: “Boko Haram insurgents have a running business to generate money to fund their dastardly activities. We fully recognize the fishery industry in Nigeria but the fishery done by Boko Haram is to create confusion, continue insurgency and destruction of the North-East.“Anybody who allows his horse or camel to carry fish for the Boko Haram, you are part of the insurgents because you are aiding them.”
