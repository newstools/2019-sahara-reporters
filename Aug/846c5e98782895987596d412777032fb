Chief Nnia Nwodo, President of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, says some Igbo are taking advantage of the attack of herdsmen in the region to kidnap and murder innocent igbo. He also lamented how local traditional rulers and vigilantes are abetting the killers in the region. In a statement on Saturday, Nwodo claimed that southern Nigeria has witnessed very unusual security breaches. “Assassinations, kidnapping and invasion of one or two holy places have been reported in the social and regular media,” he added. He, however, praised the actions of security personnel in the region while calling on traditional rulers to complement the efforts to keep southern Nigeria secured by handing over killers and kidnappers in their communities to relevant authorities. He said, “Worthy of note is the arrest of those responsible for the murder of two Catholic priests and the kidnap of a Traditional ruler. Useful confessions have been made. As we speak 1,700 forest guards are being recruited. New access roads are being constructed into desolate and hidden areas of our forests. “Ohaneze also notes that a few miscreants among us have exploited the Fulani rampage to engage in kidnapping and murder of innocent citizens. “We urge our traditional rulers, town unions and local vigilantes to fish them out and hand them over to law enforcement agencies.”
