 Ifedayo Adedipe, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) says the legitimacy of the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari is questionable because of its expressed concern over the wrong-doing on the part of the  Buhari-led administration in failing to honour court’s orders. Speaking on ChannelsTV today, Adedipe said, "What has really worried me in recent times is that wrongdoing on the part of the government is becoming more manifest and nothing challenges the legitimacy of the government than wrongdoing on the part of the government itself. “If the court makes orders and the government that is elected chooses to disobey that law and brings in some awkward explanation that the public interest or national security overrides the court pronouncement. I believe that is overkill. It is wrong and should not be allowed.” The legal expert also said Omoyele Sowore, activist and AAC candidate in the 2019 presidential election, could challenge his detention if after 45 days of ‘thorough investigation’ the Department of State Services (DSS) found nothing against him. He added, “I think the time has come for people to be challenging needless erosion of their rights and liberties.” Adedipe further explained: "If after 45 days they have nothing against him and he considers his arrest unjust. He might as well challenge it in the court and test our laws. I hope the court will stand up and defend the rights of the citizens of this country.”
