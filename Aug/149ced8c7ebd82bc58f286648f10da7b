Staff of the Lagos State Emergency Management Response Unit have threatened to embark on a strike action over five months unpaid salary, according to a report by PUNCH. The workers are said to be planning a protest for Friday at the LASEMA office in Alausa, from where the will storm the Lagos State House of Assembly to further register their grievances. One worker who spoke, said, “We are being owed five months’ salaries and nobody is saying anything. The Avantegarde is not communicating. “As a matter of fact, I learnt as of yesterday that top management staff of the firm have resigned and cleared their offices. “We don’t know who will pay us our money. For five months, no salaries. Yet, we have families to feed. We are staging a peaceful protest tomorrow in front of the Assembly. They must answer us.” Avantegarde Management Services was contracted by former governor of Lagos, Akinwunmi Ambode, under a public-private-partnership agreement, to run the state’s emergency services. Over 80,000 emergency calls are said to be received daily at the agency’s Command and Control Centre at Alausa, in the state capital Ikeja.
