A prominent human rights lawyer, Jiti Ogunye, says the PresidentMuhammadu Buhari regime has little or no regard for the rule of law inNigeria.He also accused Buhari's spokesmen, Femi Adesina and Garba Shehu ofjustifying the violations of people's rights in the country.Ogunye stated that the All Progressives Congress-led federalgovernment was characterized by various violations of the rule of law.“We have the violations of the rule of law with the spokespersons forthe government in the executive branch of the federal government ofNigeria justifying these violations on all sorts of grounds, includingthe ground of national security.“My take is that this government is not fully observant of the rule oflaw. We can’t be debating these issues as if we don’t know what we aretalking about.“There are clear cases of violations. The court will give orders inrespect of clear cases, in respect of certain persons to be releasedand they are not released,” he said.The legal practitioner stated this while appearing on a ChannelsTV programme.He also accused the Buhari regime of not obeying court orders underthe guise of 'national security'.Ogunye’s comments came on the heels of the arrest, detention, andarraignment of human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore by the Departmentof State Services (DSS) for organizing the #RevolutionNow protestwhich the federal government claimed was an attempt to violentlyoverthrow Buhari.Sowore was an opponent of the incumbent president in the lastpresidential election.
