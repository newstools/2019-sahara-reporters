Lawmaker, Enyinnaya Abaribe, has condemned the attack on former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, by alleged members of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra in Nuremberg, Germany, on Saturday. In a statement on Sunday, the Senate Minority Leader described the incident as reprehensible and utterly sacrilegious. He said, “Obviously this is not how to repay a man, an outstanding leader of men, an unpretentious Igbo leader. “He has given his all even going as far as deploying his means to arrange for the bail of Nnamdi Kanu, not minding the repercussions to his political career. “It is unfortunate. The perpetrators of the attack should know that as Igbo, we respect elders and reverence our leaders. “The unwarranted attack is not the character of the Igbo. “It is most worrisome and even inconceivable that the attackers will choose an auspicious occasion where our people are celebrating and showcasing our rich culture to exhibit such unbecoming and condemnable conduct in the name of agitation. “No, that was not agitation, no right thinking human will identify with such behaviour. “Yes, Nigeria is going through a horrendous phase, which is a fault line that her leaders, particularly we the Igbo leaders are engaging others to find a lasting solution to. “Resorting to mob mentality and venting the spleen on our leaders rather creates a vacuum that will leave our people helpless and confused in the circumstance.”
