Senior Pastor of Daystar Christian Centre, Sam Adeyemi, has called on Nigerian leaders to be courageous enough to call for national dialogue to restructure the country. The cleric said because Nigeria was created by colonialists to provide raw materials for industrialisation, the country had remained at the beck and call of Europe. In his tweet @Sam_Adeyemi, he said, “Nigeria was created by colonialists to provide raw materials for industries in Europe. “It still does in spite of independence. Can leaders in government be courageous enough to inspire and lead a national discussion to create a new Nigeria now? #leadership #NewNigeria." His tweet provoked reactions from Nigerians, who expressed divergent views on Twitter. One user, @st_prof_cas11 said, “There was a discussion for a new Nigeria during the Goodluck Jonathan administration. “For now, the implementation of the suggestions from that discourse should be our cry before further discussions on this matter or else another discussion would be held, resources would be wasted and there would be no implementation.” @amasoj20 tweeted, "Sir, I dare to say these leaders are benefitting from whatever agreement the country reached with the colonial masters back then before independence. “More reason why leadership has been revolving around same persons who led us before.” @Tunde_Adeparusi said, “It's difficult because a master will forever remain a master in the sight of his servants. “The orientation of always looking up to "masters" is very reflective in our age-long aid-seeking ideology.”
