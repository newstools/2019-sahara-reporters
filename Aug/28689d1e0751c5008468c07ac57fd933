The three suspects, who allegedly raped a female student of Ondo State College of Health Technology, Akure, would be arraigned before a magistrate court on Tuesday, Sahara Reporters has learnt. The suspects are Eyitayo Charles, 22, Aderoboye Damilola, 20, and Blessing Michael, 24. A police source, who spoke with our correspondent, said that investigation into the matter had already been concluded. “We (police) have gathered evidences against the suspects and they shall be arraigned at the Magistrate Court tomorrow (Tuesday). “It is clear that these students conspired among each other to rape the young lady but the court will finally determine that in its verdict. “And as the case proceed, we would be calling witnesses most of whom had been victims at the hands of the suspects in the past. “The school authority is aware that the suspects would be charged to court and we have already advised their parents to get them lawyers.” Efforts by Sahara Reporters to get the reaction of the school authorities proved abortive as calls placed to the mobile line of the college's Student Affairs Officer were unsuccessful.
