All gates leading into the University of Ibadan are currently under lock and key as the non-academic workers of Nigerian universities, under the aegis of the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities and Non-Academic Staff Union of Universities, began a strike it had announced earlier. The unions said it would embark on a five-day nationwide warning following the failure of the Nigerian government to meet their demands after the expiration of a 14-day ultimatum. Wale Akinremi, the Chairman of SSANU, told SaharaReporters that the strike would continue after the warning strike except their demands were met. The demands of the unions included the payment of their earned allowances, the university staff schools’ matter, and the renegotiation of the 2019 federal government’s agreement with the unions. The unions instructed all members and institutions to comply with the warning strike from Monday or face sanctions. As of the time of filing this report, there were no non-academic activities taking place in the institutions.
