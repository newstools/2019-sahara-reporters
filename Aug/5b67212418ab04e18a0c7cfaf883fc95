Convener of Bring Back Our Girls movement, Oby Ezekwesile, has cautioned the Nigerian Government over the continued detention of pro-democracy activist, Omoyele Sowore. Ezekwesili gave the note of warning via her Twitter handle on Tuesday, stating that the government cannot cage Sowore nor his ideas. Sowore has been held by the Department of State Services since August 3, 2019 when he was arrested in Lagos for calling on Nigerians to pour out to the streets and express their displeasure with bad leadership in the country. The DSS had sought a Federal High Court order to hold Sowore for 90 days but the court granted them 45 days. The Nigerian Government is accusing Sowore of planning to topple the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari. Sowore, through his lawyer, Femi Falana, filed a counter affidavit responding to the accusation of the Nigerian Government. Reacting to the development, Ezekwesili said, "Our FG  @NigeriaGov led by @NGRPresident @MBuhari may think they have ‘caged’ @YeleSowore because he dared to challenge bad leadership and poor governance through #RevolutionNow. "Not so, actually. His idea can never be caged. Why? You cannot cage an idea whose time has come.”
