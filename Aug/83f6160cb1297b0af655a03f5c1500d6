Four people have been killed in an attempt to rescue an entrepreneur, Mercy Gabriel, who was abducted by gunmen at Obu Branch in Otukpa town of Ogbadibo Local Government Area of Benue state. Ms. Gabriel was reportedly kidnapped about 9:30 pm in front of her shop at the ever-busy Obu Branch in Benue’s Ogbadigbo area linking Ankpa in Kogi state. Witnesses said the kidnapped victim who had completed her National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) about a month ago owns a communication outfit in the town and was busy in one of her two shops when gunmen forced her into their waiting vehicle and sped off in the direction of Ankpa road. The report noted that some men who saw what happened quickly rode on motorcycles and pursued the abductors in a bid to rescue the woman but were knocked down by a vehicle leaving four people dead on the spot. The Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) in Benue state, Aliyu Baba, told Daily Trust that the four persons who died were sympathizers who witnessed the lady being taken away and decided alongside others to pursue the abductors. Baba said, unknowingly to the deceased, there was another vehicle coming from the opposite direction with a headlight which suggested it was rather a motorcycle and before they could veer off the road properly, the vehicle collided with them. “Four of them (men) died,” the sector commander said. When contacted, the state’s Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Catherine Anene, said she had yet to receive any briefing on the incident.
