Nigerian-bornBritish heavyweight boxer, Anthony Joshua, has said that he does not have any respect for Lennox Lewis after the former pugilist criticised his preparation for the fight against Andy Ruiz Jr in New York in which Joshua lost. Lewis, according to Daily MailUK, was Britain's last undisputed heavyweight champion. In a tweet, Lewis had said, “I can't look at that fight and agree that AJ was fully prepared.” But reacting to the criticism in a Sky Sports documentary, Joshua said that he was a different person from Lewis and so does things his own way. He said, “Lennox is a clown. I don't respect Lennox. I and Lennox are not the same. “My legacy is to sit back and enjoy the younger generation coming up, and not to be involved. Just to appreciate what it takes to get there. Lennox isn't like that.” Joshua is set to take on Ruiz in the rematch of their fight in Saudi Arabia on December 7. The IBF, WBA and WBO heavyweight titles will be at stake during the fight.
