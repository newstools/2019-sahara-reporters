As the national refineries remain moribund, the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), on Sunday announced a new set of companies that will lift the country’s crude oil and supply it with refined petroleum products. In a press release obtained from its Twitter handle, @NNPCgroup, it said a batch of 15 consortia were chosen in an open tender to sell petroleum and purchase the  commensurate value of refined products from October 1, 2019 to September 31, 2020. The corporation, however, stopped short of listing the barrels of petroleum per day each group of firms are to carry and dispose of. “Under the DSDP arrangement, the under listed fifteen (15) consortia/companies shall over the contract period, offtake crude oil and in return, deliver corresponding petroleum products of equivalent value to NNPC, subject to the terms of the agreement," said a statement by NNPC's spokesman, Ndu Ughamadu. The companies selected are listed below. 1.  BP OIL INTERNATIONAL LTD./AYM SHAFA LTD. 2.  VITOL SA/CALSON-HYSON 3.  TOTSA TOTAL OIL TRADING SA/TOTAL NIG. PL 4.  GUNVOR INTERNATIONAL B.V./AY MAIKIFI OIL & GAS CO. LTD. 5.  TRAFIGURA PTE LTD./A. A. RANO NIG. LTD 6.  CEPSA S.A.U./OANDO PLC 7.  MOCOH SA/MOCOH NIG. LTD. 8.  LITASCO SA/BRITTANIA-U NIG.

The corporation said the tender process comprised of technical and commercial bid submission, as well as evaluation and shortlisting. This was followed by commercial negotiations with prequalified companies and the subsequent engagement of the successful consortia/companies by NNPC. The Buhari administration did away with the shady offshore processing agreement or oil – swap – deal in August 2015, in favour of the direct sale – direct purchase agreement used presently. Between 2010 and 2014, media reports say the country lost petroleum products in excess of $35 billion, with Diezani Alison-Madueke, ex-Minister of Petroleum Resources said to be the overseer of the scheme.
