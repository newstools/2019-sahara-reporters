  At least 63 people have been confirmed dead after a suicide bomber detonated a bomb in Kabul, capital of Afghanistan, on Saturday. The Afghanistan interior ministry confirmed the death toll hours after the bombing. The explosion happened during a wedding ceremony with thousands of people reported to be attending, witnesses told the BBC. Not less than 180 people were wounded and are currently receiving treatment with many of the victims confirmed to be women and kids. The groom, Mirwais, who spoke with local media, lamented the blast saying, “My family, my bride are in shock, they cannot even speak. My bride keeps fainting. “I lost my brother, I lost my friends, I lost my relatives. I will never see happiness in my life again.” President of Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani, has convened an “extraordinary security” meeting to prevent a reoccurrence of such attack. He said, “I strongly condemn the inhumane attack on the wedding hall in Kabul on Saturday night. “My top priority for now is to reach out to the families of victims of this barbaric attack. On behalf of the nation I send my heartfelt condolences to the families of those who were martyred. “For those who are wounded, I pray for your speedy recovery. I have ordered the relevant authorities to urgently assist in managing the wounded. “In response to this targeted attack, I have called an extraordinary security meeting to review and prevent such security lapses.”
