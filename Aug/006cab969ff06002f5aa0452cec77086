 Two persons were killed in the early hours of Tuesday in Azubuogu community under Oyigbo Local Government Area of Rivers State when gunmen invaded the place. Several persons were injured by the yet-to-be identified hoodlums while dozens of residents have been forced to vacate the area for fear of further attacks, according to a report by PUNCH. A source close to the community, who identified himself as Onyeka, said the people of Azubuogu were taken unawares by the attackers, adding that the attack could be related to a protracted land dispute. He said, “We cannot particularly state the real cause of the attack but we suspect that it could be connected to an unresolved land dispute. “I heard that two persons were killed while several others were injured.” Confirming the incident, spokesperson for the police in Rivers, Nnamdi Omoni, said they were on the trail of the attackers. Omoni said, “It happened in Oyigbo LGA. From the real-time report I got from the Divisional Police Officer in Oyigbo, they said one person was killed. “This happened when youths from Ogoni invaded Azubuogu community and attacked some persons. But normalcy has been restored and an investigation is ongoing. “We suspect the attack could be as a result of a land dispute but the ongoing investigation will reveal the real cause of the attack.”
