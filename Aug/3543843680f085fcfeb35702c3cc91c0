A blogger based in Imo State, Ifeanyi Onyenankeya, has regained his freedom after spending four days at the hands of his abductors. Onyenankeya, who runs popular news blogs – Okigwe Arena and Imo Arena – was released on Thursday night, according to a family, who asked not to be named. On Monday, three armed men had seized the blogger from his father’s compound at 3 Duru Close, Ekeagbara, Okigwe, after physically assaulting him. They later demanded N1.5m as ransom for his freedom. The relative said, “He has been released by his kidnappers. He was released on Thursday night. “He is devastated and was manhandled. He has been hospitalised owing to the injury he sustained. “Remember that he was beaten before being whisked away. Ransom was paid but we don’t want to make it public. “The good news is that he is with us. We are grateful to the police, especially SARS operatives for the role they played during this ugly incident.” Spokesperson for the police in Imo State, Orlando Ikeokwu, said that he had yet to be informed of the developmental when contacted by PUNCH.
