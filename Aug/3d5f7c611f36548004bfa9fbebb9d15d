According to the News Agency of Nigeria, prosecutor of the case, Insp. Ben Ekundayo, said the offence was committed by the defendant between June and August in Lagos Island. He disclosed that his victims were one Mr Olayinka Olajuwon and the people introduced to him by Olajuwon. Ekundayo said the agreement between the victims and suspect was to help them secure travel tickets to the United Kingdom and United Arab Emirates, which he failed to do.
