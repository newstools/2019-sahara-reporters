The Peoples Democratic Party and its governorship candidate during the March 2019 election in Kaduna State, Isah Ashiru, will on Monday ask the elections petition tribunal in the state to cancel a total 515, 951 votes, which it contends were unlawfully added to the total votes cast. The tribunal has fixed August 19 for adoption of final written addresses by counsel in the governorship election case, according to a document obtained by the News Agency of Nigeria on Sunday in Kaduna. In the document, the PDP is asking the tribunal to declare Ashiru as the validly elected governor of the state by majority of lawful votes. The petitioners had called 135 witnesses out of the 685 they assembled to prove massive rigging, ballot stuffing and other irregularities during the poll as contained in their petition. In their final written addresses, the petitioners alleged that the Independent National Electoral Commission had added 391,741 votes to Nasiru El-Rufai of APC and a total of 124, 210 unlawful votes to the PDP through wrong or double entry on the result sheets. The PDP and its candidate contend that declaring El-Rufai winner by INEC was illegal as he did not score majority of lawful votes. The PDP through its legal team said a deduction of 391,741 votes from 1,045,427 scored by El-Rufai and 124,210 from Ashiru’s 814, 168 votes will give victory to their candidate. The counsel further argued that after the deduction of the alleged unlawful votes, Ashiru will be left with 689,958 lawful votes, while El-Rufai will have 653,686 votes. The party also submitted that it had produced enough material evidence of substantial irregularities to enable the tribunal declare its candidate winner of the March 9 governorship election in Kaduna State. The Tribunal, headed by Justice Ibrahim Bako is expected to receive the final written addresses of the parties in the petition beginning from Monday.
