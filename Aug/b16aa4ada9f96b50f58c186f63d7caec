An auto crash involving the convoy of Zamfara State Governor, Alhaji Bello Matawalle, has claimed the lives of two policemen attached to the governor. Yusuf Idris, the Director-General on Press Affairs to the governor, confirmed the incident in a press statement on Thursday in Gusau. According to Idris, the crash occurred along Funtua/Gusau road on Thursday, disclosing that a police inspector, Aminu Usman and a sergeant, Nura Mohammed, were killed on the spot. The statement noted that the policemen had escorted the governor to Abuja on a five-day official trip. The governor's spokesman said further that while they were returning from Abuja, one of the vehicles in the convoy broke down in Zaria, Kaduna State. “The two policemen were among the seven persons left behind to oversee the repairs of the broken down vehicle before coming to Gusau. “About two hours later, however, the sad news was brought to the governor that those left behind were involved in the crash while driving in a heavy downpour and that the two policemen had died. “Amidst tears, the governor directed the evacuation of the wounded persons from Funtua General Hospital where they were receiving treatment to a referral hospital for better care under the supervision of the governor’s personal physician. "The doctor was also directed to update the governor on the progress of the treatment,” the statement said. Idris went on to explain that while one of the victims survived the crash unhurt, the remaining four sustained varying degree of injuries. He added that the governor had condoled with the families of the deceased and said the state government would pay all medical bill of those hospitalized.
