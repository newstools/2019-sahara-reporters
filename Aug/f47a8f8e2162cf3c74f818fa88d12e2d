The Appeal Court sitting in Port Harcourt has set aside the judgment of the Rivers State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal that dismissed the petition of the candidate of the African Action Congress, Biokpomabo Awara, for abandoning their petition.The five-man panel consequently directed all parties to return to the tribunal to hear the matter on its merit.The judgment read by Justice J.O Bada disclosed that the appellant did no harm for requesting the regularisation of his suit.Awara, who spoke to Sahara Reporters reporters said that the ruling is a "victory for democracy".
