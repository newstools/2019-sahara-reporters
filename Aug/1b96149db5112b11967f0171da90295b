Torrential rain has destroyed makeshift tents and caused severeflooding to temporary displacement camps in northeast Nigeria, leavingvulnerable families homeless.The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said it was worried about thesituation and thus appealed for "urgent financial assistance" toaddress the colossal humanitarian needs and to prevent the spread ofdeadly cholera.“Displaced people are suffering due to relentless rains and windbattering their homes the last few days. Large numbers of families,who fled from conflict months ago, are left homeless while others areforced to share overcrowded tents with neighbours or relatives,” saidEric Batonon, Country Director for NRC in Nigeria.According to NRC's assessments, over 6,800 people living indisplacement camps in Maiduguri have been impacted by floods in recentweeks. In Dikwa, 500 people have been rendered homeless due toflooding and have set up home in disused registration centres.“They are essentially displaced within a displacement camp,” Batonon added.“My home is completely destroyed. My floor has turned to mud and wateris everywhere. The rain keeps coming and we do not have any choice butto wait for it to stop or share with others,” said displacedmother-of-four Fatima Mohammed (30).The Adamawa State government, the organization said, had officiallydeclared an outbreak of cholera in three local government areas duringthe rainy season.The total number of cases reported as of August 16 stands at 633.Four people have so far lost their lives to the disease. Due to recentheavy rain and flooding, more cases could be confirmed over the comingweeks, the NRC pointed out.“Displaced people are living in sub-human conditions across theregion. There are no sanitation or drainage facilities in most camps.People are going to the toilet in open spaces because there are nofacilities for them to use and now that the camps are filled withstagnant floodwater, water-borne diseases like cholera quicklyspread,” Batonon added.Meanwhile, the United Nations and partners have appealed for $848million to address the needs in northeast Nigeria this year. Abouteight months into the year, less than 40 per cent has been received.“Additional financial support is urgently needed to reach the 6.2million people targeted for humanitarian aid in 2019. People will dieif they don´t receive urgent assistance now,” Batonon said.Furthermore, heavy rain periods present opportunities by armed groupsto infiltrate and target displacement camps.On Tuesday night (August 20) in Dikwa, a female suicide bomberdetonated a bomb, killing herself and injuring four civilians.This was the first attack of its kind in the area since December 2018.
