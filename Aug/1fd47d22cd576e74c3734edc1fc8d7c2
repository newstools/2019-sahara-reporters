Embattled Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki says he has met with his predecessor, the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, claiming that they have no 'fundamental issues'.He, however, admitted that things were going on fine in the state over an alleged lingering crisis between the duo.Obaseki, in his address during a mass at the St. Paul Catholic Church, as part of activities marking the 80th birthday celebration of Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, said, “I listened very attentively and I have taken every word in your homily remark to heart and very seriously.“I want to assure you that we are in pursuit of peace and we will have peace in Edo State. We have met (with Oshiomhole) and fortunately, we do not have any fundamental issues."And because we do not have any fundamental issues, I believe that whatever third parties are trying to propagate, I am sure we can talk over it. I assure you that very soon things will return to normalcy in Edo State."
