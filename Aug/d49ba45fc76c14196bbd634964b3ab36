The Nigerian government says it will cooperate with the government of the United States of America in extraditing and prosecuting 80 Nigerians suspected of cyber-crime through romance scams.The presidency conveyed its decision in a ChannelsTV interview with the presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, monitored by SaharaReporter on Monday.Shehu said, “The action of a few Nigerians is not the action of whole of Nigerians in this country, we are 200 million-plus in this country and you are talking about 80 in this case in the United States of America.He said the government is willing to cooperate in matters of extradition and in any way necessary to prosecute the suspects.“They will face the justice system in the country if the Nigerian government is required to cooperate - in extradition or anyway - if it meets the requirements of our laws, they will be assisted to prosecute them and to face justice in this country.“This thing is not about Nigerians, Nigerians are honest and hard-working people all over the world. There are millions of our citizens who are out there earning legitimately their own income and they do not deserve to be tarnished.“The diaspora commission is always there and the Nigerian government has taken a stand on this matter, its cooperation all the way.”
