 Okoi Obono-Obla, the chairman of the Special Investigation Panel for the Recovery of Public Property, Chief Okoi Obono-Obla, has been sacked. President Muhammadu Buhari terminated his appointment via a letter on Tuesday, Daily Trust reports. The sack letter, according to the newspaper, was delivered to the Solicitor-General of the Federation and Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Justice, Obla’s supervising ministry. “With the information at our disposal, he will face criminal prosecution on matters related to his alleged financial dealings, as uncovered by the ICPC upon investigation,” Daily Trust quoted a source as saying. “The government may ask the University of Jos to withdraw his law degree and the Nigerian Law School to debar him from practice. “This is owing to the conclusion of the ICPC investigation, the recommendations of which were approved in full by President Buhari,” the source added. The newspaper reported another source as saying: “Actually once when confronted with some of his alleged misconduct and other allegations, Obono-Obla pleaded and was made to sign an undertaking to mend his ways, but no sooner had he signed than he abandoned the undertaking and continued violating the law and regulations in place in the conduct of the work of the panel. “Following series of violations for which he was queried, Mr. Obla submitted a written undertaking to the effect that the panel under his leadership would only act on a written mandate received from the Presidency, and will seek authorization from the Presidency to undertake fresh mandates in accordance with extant laws of the Federation. “The main grouse against the panel chairman was that while the panel was supposed to investigate only cases referred to it by the government, according to the law establishing the panel but the chairman has single-handedly taken on cases outside of the panel's mandate and in gross violation of rule of law, including violations of people’s fundamental human rights."
