The Central Bank of Nigeria has warned Nigerians to beware of social media scams using the apex bank as bait to lure unsuspecting Nigerians to part with funds in the guise of providing federal government loans. In a tweet on Monday, the CBN through its verified Twitter handle @cenbank said, “CBN has nothing to do with fraudulent messages on social media requesting unsuspecting loan seekers and owners of small-scale businesses to apply for loans provided by the Federal Government through the email: empowermentcbnloan@gmail.com. Please beware!”
