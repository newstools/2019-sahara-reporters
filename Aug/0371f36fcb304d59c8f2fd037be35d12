Former governor of Abia State and sitting senator, Orji Uzor Kalu, has cancelled his trip to Spain after members of the Indigenous People of Biafra in Germany attacked former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, on Saturday. Kalu however, said his decision to ditch the trip was not to avoid assault from members of IPOB. In statement on Monday, Kalu explained that he has been in his country home, Igbere, interacting with members of his constituency since the National Assembly went on recess. The lawmaker said he had held several meetings with the people of Abia North at his residence in Igbere. The statement reads, “I have been in my country home interacting with people from my constituency and settling disputes. “The news that I suspended my planned medical trip abroad is not true. “I was invited by an Igbo group in Spain to attend their function, I could not go because of the interaction with my constituents.”
