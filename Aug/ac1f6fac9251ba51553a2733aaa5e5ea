“The indictment and criminal complaint allege that Iro and Igbokwe,who were among those arrested this morning, were involved in schemesresulting in the fraudulent transfer of at least $6 million infraudulently-obtained funds – and the overall conspiracy wasresponsible for the attempted theft of at least an additional $40million.“The fraudsters targeted victims in the United States and across theglobe, including individuals, small and large businesses, and lawfirms. Some of the victims of the conspiracy lost hundreds ofthousands of dollars to fraud schemes, and many were elderly. Thiscase is part of our ongoing efforts to protect Americans fromfraudulent online schemes and to bring to justice those who prey uponAmerican citizens and businesses."Hanna added, "We have taken a major step to disrupt criminal networksthat use BEC schemes, romance scams and other frauds to fleecevictims. This indictment sends a message that we will identifyperpetrators – no matter where they reside – and we will cut off theflow of ill-gotten gains.”Similarly, the assistant director in charge, Paul Delacourt of theFBI’s Los Angeles Field Office, noted: "(The) announcement highlightsthe extensive efforts that organized criminal groups will engage in toperpetrate BEC schemes that target American citizens and theirhard-earned assets.“Billions of dollars are lost annually, and we urge citizens to beaware of these sophisticated financial schemes to protect themselvesor their businesses from becoming unsuspecting victims. The FBI iscommitted to working with our partner agencies worldwide to continueto identify these cybercriminals and to dismantle their networks.“Iro and Igbokwe essentially were brokers of fraudulent bank accounts.According to the indictment, Iro and Igbokwe collected bank accounts,fielded requests for bank account information, provided thatinformation to co-conspirators around the world, and laundered themoney obtained from victims – all of this in exchange for a cut of themoney stolen from victims of the various fraud schemes."Delacourt pointed out further, “If a bank account with a specificbusiness name was required to trick a business-victim into making apayment, Iro and Igbokwe often coordinated with “money mules” to openaccounts that could receive funds obtained, according to courtdocuments. In addition to making the fake business name mirror thename of a legitimate company, members of the conspiracy routinelyfiled fictitious business name statements with the Los Angeles CountyRegistrar/Recorder’s Office that were presented to banks when thefraudulent accounts were opened.“Once a victim deposited funds into a bank account or a money servicesaccount, Iro and Igbokwe allegedly coordinated with others to furtherlaunder the funds. Members of the conspiracy sometimes wired funds toother bank accounts under their control; in other cases, they simplywithdrew funds as cash or negotiable instruments such as cashier’schecks. “When stolen funds were withdrawn as cash, the defendants frequentlyused illicit money exchangers to move funds overseas, generallyavoiding transferring the funds directly through banking institutions,the indictment alleges. To do this, Iro and Igbokwe coordinated thetransfer of a victim’s funds from a fraudulent bank account theycontrolled to U.S. bank accounts belonging to illicit moneyexchangers. Those money exchangers, in turn, used a Nigerian bankingapplication to transfer other funds in naira (₦), the currency ofNigeria, from Nigerian bank accounts they controlled to the Nigerianbank accounts specified by Iro and Igbokwe."This method, he said, was used to transfer millions of dollars totheir Nigerian co-conspirators without directly transferring fundsoverseas.The indictment alleged that Jerry Ikogho, 50, of Carson (who was takeninto custody on Sunday), and Adegoke Moses Ogungbe, 34, of Fontana,were among those who served as illicit money exchangers for theconspiracy.Each of the defendants named in the indictment was charged withconspiracy to commit fraud, conspiracy to launder money, andaggravated identity theft.A number of the defendants also face substantive fraud and moneylaundering charges.Additionally, Iro, Igbokwe, Ikogho, Ogungbe, and three otherdefendants –Izuchukwu Kingsley Umejesi, 30, of Los Angeles, TityayeMarina Mansbangura, 33, of Palmdale, and Obi Madekwe, 31, of Nigeria –were charged with operating illegal money transmitting businesses.Ogungbe and Mansbangura were also among those arrested, and Umejesiconsidered a fugitive is currently being sought by authorities.Delacourt continued: “Iro, Igbokwe and Chuks Eroha, 39, faceadditional charges for attempting to destroy their phones when the FBIexecuted a search warrant in July 2017. Iro also is charged with lyingto the FBI in an interview conducted during the search. The complaintalleges that, when the FBI arrived to conduct the court-authorizedsearch at Iro’s apartment in Carson, Iro broke his phone in half,while Igbokwe and Eroha threw phones from a bedroom window of theapartment."While Iro claimed he previously had broken the phone during anargument with his wife, the complaint details how the FBI was able todetermine that the phone was operational until seconds after the FBIknocked on Iro’s apartment door to execute the search warrant. Erohais believed to have fled to Nigeria shortly after the FBI executed thewarrant.“The charges contained in the criminal complaint and indictment aremerely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unlessand until proven guilty in a court. This investigation is being led bythe Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Los Angeles County DistrictAttorney’s Office, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, andthe United States Department of State provided substantial assistanceduring the investigation.Documents obtained by SaharaReporters showed that several agenciesprovided support during the takedown or during the investigation,including the United States Postal Inspection Service, U.S.Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland SecurityInvestigations, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, U.S.Customs and Border Protection, the Ventura County District Attorney’sOffice and the California Franchise Tax Board.Many of the FBI’s legal attachés provided assistance throughout theinvestigation, including the Criminal Division’s Office ofInternational Affairs, and foreign authorities around the world."In particular," said Delacourt, "the FBI and U.S. Attorney’s Officethank the National Crime Agency in the United Kingdom and the PublicProsecutor’s Office of Osnabrück, Germany for their contributions.“This case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States AttorneysAnil J. Antony and Joseph B. Woodring of the Cyber and IntellectualProperty Crimes Section.“The FBI in 2017 issued a report on the rise of BEC schemes andpublished a recap of 2018’s Operation WireWire, which was aninternational effort to disrupt international BEC scams. An FBI publicservice announcement that warns of the dangers of BEC schemesencourages businesses to 'trust but verify'.”
