  Workers of the Federal College of Agriculture (FECA) Akure, Ondo State, has protested the alleged sacking of the institution's acting Provost, Dr. Emmanuel Moyinjesu, by the Agriculture Research Council of Nigeria. Punch reports that Moyinjesu had served as the acting provost of the institution following the end of the tenure of former substantive Provost, Dr. Samson Odedina, whose tenure as provost came to an end last year. Although the reason why the acting provost was sacked was not revealed this development has led to a protest by workers of the school who were seen on Monday with placards with inscriptions like, ‘Save FECA from collapse',  ‘Dissolve Governing Board’ and ‘Call ARCN to order', among others. The workers claimed to members of the Academic Staff Union of Polytechnic, FECA chapter. Speaking with journalists, the Chairman of FECA’s chapter of ASUP, Mr. Ogunyinka Abimbola said, “If the government is saying they want to change the acting provost, there is no problem. But they must tell us his offence because the rules say the most senior staff should be appointed as acting provost when there is a vacancy. “But surprisingly, the newly appointed acting provost is in fourth position on the line. The news of his appointment came to us suddenly, last Friday. “We have had many acting provosts in the college and the due process was followed.  Why the difference now?  Even recently the ARCN appointed the most senior officer at the Federal College of Agriculture, Ibadan. “There will always be different opinions and views because we have freedom of expression to express our thoughts. But I must tell you that we have other two unions in the college that are not protesting and their members are at their duty posts."
