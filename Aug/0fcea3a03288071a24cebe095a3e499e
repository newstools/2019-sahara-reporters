Controversial Apostle Johnson Suleiman's church, Omega Fire Ministry, was among many buildings that were flooded following a downpour that lasted for hours between Sunday and Monday. News Agency of Nigeria reports that at least 10 houses, farmlands, shops, others were destroyed by flood in Gudaba community of Kuje area of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The flood also affected a bridge linking Kuje-Gwagwalada road, forcing residents to stay indoors or wade through the water. Zaka Tukura, whose house collapsed, told the news agency: “I was asleep when the water flooded my house. I had to quickly move my children to a neighbour’s house. “The level of destruction is devastating; it is quite unfortunate that the flood has affected many people in this community.” Another resident, Sarah Musa, said, “We could not sleep throughout because of the downpour. When the rain kept persisting, we knew we were in danger and started removing our property from the building even when we were not sure which area could be safe.” She said her family members succeeded in moving some important household items before the house collapsed. Mrs. Machbery Modupe, Head, Department of Works, Kuje Area Council, said, “We are already assessing the situation to ascertain the number of houses affected by the flood. The aim is to see how the victims can be supported.”
