Wife of the publisher of CrossRiverWatch, Agba Jalingo, Violet, has said that the state governor, Ben Ayade, was persecuting her husband for exposing corruption in his government. Jalingo was arrested on Thursday in Lagos and taken to Calabar, capital of Cross River State, by officers of the Nigeria Police allegedly on the request of the governor. Speaking with Sahara Reporters on Monday, Violet called for the immediate and unconditionally release of her husband. She said, “When they came into our living room, I heard voices but I never bothered to check because I thought it was my husband's people who came to see him. “However, my husband called out to me that policemen were in the house, so I ran out of the bedroom only to see three men on mufti surrounding my husband, at that point I inquired for their identity. “I also asked them for the warrant of arrest but they told me to go away, that they have no business with me. They told me they came for my husband, that he has a case to answer in Calabar. “Ben Ayade is punishing my husband for exposing corruption in his government. My husband could not have been arrested because of #RevolutionNow protest because he protested in Lagos, not Cross River. “I am calling for his immediate and unconditional release.”
