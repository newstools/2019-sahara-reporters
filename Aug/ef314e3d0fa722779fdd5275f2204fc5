India Police A Nigerian named Patrick and Malian, Ibrahim Ruman, have been arrested by the police in India for possession of fake currencies. The duo were nabbed in a hotel on Sunday as part of the city's police investigation into possible international fake Indian currency note racket. City police commissioner, Deepak Kumar said, “The duo were booked under the Passport and Investigation Act. “They are being quizzed and have been taken for a medical check on Monday. “The seizures included papers which were possibly being used for printing fake Rs 2000 notes. “The duo might be involved in supplying papers to other gangs operating in the region.” The arrest is coming days after the United States charged 80 people, mostly Nigerians, for Internet romance scams, which swindled Americans and other nationals of millions of dollars.
