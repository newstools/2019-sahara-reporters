The Socio-Economic Right And Accountability Project has begun legal move to stop the Nigeria's federal lawmakers from spending N5 billion to buy 'official' cars. There was outrage following media reports that the lawmakers had budgeted N5 billion to buy sport utility vehicles for themselves. Following the report, SERAP took to its social media platform to announce that it would file a lawsuit against the lawmakers, stopping the planned spending. The organization also called on Nigerians to join the suit by expressing interest through the filling of an online form. SERAP tweeted, “SERAP is asking Nigerians to support its suit against the plan by the 9th Senate to spend N5.550 billion on new cars at N50m each for 109 senators. Kindly indicate interest to join the suit by filling this form here.” The form would only require interested Nigerians to fill their names and locations.
