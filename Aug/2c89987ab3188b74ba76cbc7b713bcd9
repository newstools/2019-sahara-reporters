  Bello Salim, a former registrar of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) says the proposed seven-year jail term for anyone involved in examination malpractices should be enforced.SaharaReporters recalls that earlier in the year results of over 30,000 candidates were withheld by JAMB on the premise of examination malpractices.The ex-JAMB registrar in a JAMB bulletin, according to Premium Times, declared that the war against exam malpractice was not yet won.”Examination malpractice is a global malaise. The battle is ongoing; we have not won it. When you present examination malpractice suspects at the beginning of August, for instance, and a court hearing is fixed for the middle of October, the hearing is adjourned almost as soon as it starts to maybe January. The court process will thus keep dragging on,” he said.He advised that since examinations had gone digital, the law governing the conduct of examinations should go digital as well.Salim said that there should be mobile courts the same way there are election tribunals that are set aside to handle electoral matters.”We should have penalties that are enforceable. The prescribed seven-year jail term for anyone involved in examination malpractices should be enforced,” he said.
