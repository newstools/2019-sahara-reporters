File photo A bridge connecting Magali and Michika local government areas of Adamawa State to the rest of the state has collapsed due to a downpour, SaharaReporters can report. As things stand, the two LGAs will remain disconnected from Nigeria's land transport system Residents of the area have been exposed to Boko Haram attacks, considering the closeness of the place to Boko Haram-occupied Sambisa forest. The collapsed bridge in Dilchim, Michika LGA, is about the onlyÂ surviving bridge linking Michika/Madagali communities to Yola, the state capital.In 2014 when Boko Haram captured and occupied seven LGAs in Adamawa state, Kudzum bridge, two kilometers away from Dilchim bridge was blown up by the military to prevent Boko Haram terrorists from crossing over close to Yola. Since then, commuters from the far northern axis have relied on a makeshift military bridge constructed at Kudzum to connect to Michika/Madagali axis. Meanwhile, Governor Ahmadu Fintiri has expressed concerns over the collapsed bridge. He expressed dismay that the contract of the Kudzum bridge, awarded sometimes in 2015 had yet to be completed. But the site engineer at the Kudzum Bridge, Joshua Yakubu, told SaharaReporters that the delay was "due to the activities of the terrorists, which devastated the area".
