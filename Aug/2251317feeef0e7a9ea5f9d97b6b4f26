So, we are extremelyconcerned on how to improve education; technical education, inparticular, I think that it is very important.“As a matter of fact, under our N-Power scheme we already have anumber of technical education schemes going on.  We have what we callN-Build which is technical education for persons involved in thebuilding industry (tillers, brick layers etc). We also have trainingfor extension workers, persons who will provide extension service."There is the one for persons involved in technical training likecarpenter, electricians, and many others,” he said.He added that the Federal and state governments were committed todoing more in terms of technical education.Osinbajo said there was also collaboration  in supporting the statesespecially in making primary education and first three years ofsecondary education free and compulsory as well as in the education ofyoung women.In his remarks, Chindo commended the vice president for his show ofconcern and interest in the welfare of the people of Nasarawa Stateand Keffi in particular.The traditional ruler appealed to the federal government to review thenation’s education curriculum to integrate vocational and technicaleducation to address youth unemployment, News Agency of Nigeriareports.
