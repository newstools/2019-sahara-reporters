Indonesian Ambassador to Nigeria, Dr. Usra Hendra Harahap, says Indonesian is ready to strengthen military cooperation with Nigeria at a time of Nigeria's rising level of insecurity. The ambassador revealed this during the 74th Independence anniversary and flag hoisting of the Republic of Indonesia in Abuja. Harahap who said Indonesia and Nigeria had enjoyed decades-long relations in bilateral and military cooperation indicated that his posting to Nigeria as well as that of a defence attache is an indication of Indonesia’s commitment to strengthening the existing relationships between the two countries. “I have a military background. My posting to Nigeria is to consolidate on the existing military cooperation between the two nations. We also have a defence attache. It is through the DA that a lot of military cooperation will be discussed. “Military cooperation was one of the issues I discussed with President Buhari when I submitted my letter of credential. We have to strengthen cooperation in training, knowledge-sharing, reciprocal exchange and military equipment,” he explained.
