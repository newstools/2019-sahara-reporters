  Former Vice President and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party during the 2019 Presidential election, Atiku Abubakar, has said that it was wrong to criminalise donations to institutions promoting peace in Nigeria and Africa. Abubakar said this in a statement issued by his Media Office in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital, on Monday. His position was in reaction to a publication alleging that his son-in-law, Babalele Abdullahi, donated cash to the Olusegun Obasanjo Library in Abeokuta, Ogun State. He said, “For the avoidance of doubt, Abdullahi, did not donate any money in cash to the Obasanjo Library. “Yes, he did facilitate a donation of N50m to the Obasanjo Presidential Library, but so did many other individuals, including civic-minded traditional rulers, state governors, bankers and captains of industry. “This is because the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library is a non-governmental organisation that plays a pivotal role in promoting peace and stability in Nigeria, and that should be applauded. “The sources of these funds are completely legitimate and have been conclusively proven to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. “Let it be known that the government established the EFCC to be an investigative body and not a propaganda or enforcement arm.”
