 The Human Rights Writers Association Of Nigeria has criticised the appointment of Muslims as ministers of Interior and Defence by President Muhammadu Buhari. The group said the development in a heterogeneous society like Nigeria contravenes section 42(1) of the constitution, which prohibits discrimination. In a statement by the National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko, and National Media Affairs Director, Zainab Yusuf, HURIWA condemned the domination of juicy offices by Northern Nigeria. The group said, “We are not happy that most of the cabinet appointments are cornered to the North-West. “It’s unfair because the Igbo population in Nigeria is not less than 50million and constitutionally either people vote for you or not, you must appoint one minister from each state of the federation.
