The Nigerian Customs Service through the strike force of the Controller General of Customs on Friday raided a warehouse in Lagos where cartons of codeine, tramadol and other illegal drugs worth N5bn were kept. The warehouse located along the Mile-Oshodi Expressway, was raided after a trailer of the drugs was intercepted at the Maryland area of Lagos. Team leader of the Customs Strike Force Zone A, Usman Yahaya, said, “Immediately it was brought to our notice, we carried out a preliminary investigation that led to the discovery of a warehouse along Oshodi-Mile 2 Road stocked with tramadol, codeine and other unregistered pharmaceutical products without NAFDAC numbers. “The warehouse was immediately sealed with a detachment of well-armed officers to guard the place. “The drugs estimated to be loaded in 21 trailers with street value of over N5bn are being evaluated for custody and subsequent judicial process and destruction. "Three weeks ago, the agency in collaboration with the National Administration of Food Drug Administration and Control destroyed 48 by 40 feet of controlled drugs worth N146bn in Ogun State. “We therefore call on well-meaning Nigerians to support the Nigerian Customs Service on this resolution.”
