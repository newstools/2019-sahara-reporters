 The Nigerian Embassy in Ukraine has petitioned the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Police Department in Kharkiv, demanding full investigations into circumstances surrounding the alleged stabbing to death of a Nigerian, Gbolade Ejemai, on August 8. Ejemai, a medical doctor, was allegedly stabbed to death by one Victoria Popravko, with the connivance of her father in Ukraine. The Chairman, Nigerians in Diaspora Commission, Mrs Abike Dabiri-Erewa, who had been in touch with the family of the deceased and Nigerian Embassy in Ukraine, confirmed the petition in a statement on Tuesday. The statement was signed by NIDCOM’s Head of Media, Abdur-Rahman Balogun, in Abuja. Dabiri-Erewa said the petition was delivered to the Ukrainian authorities on behalf of the Nigerian Government. She said, “We have requested for a full and thorough investigation into the circumstance surrounding his demise, with a view to ensuring that justice is carried out.” Dabiri-Erewa described the killing of Ejemai as a sad one and prayed for God to give his family the fortitude to bear the loss.
