A major opponent of President Muhammadu Buhari in the February 2019 presidential election, Atiku Abubakar, says the federal government controlled by the All Progressives Congress is desperate to implicate former President Olusegun Obasanjo in a crime of money laundering and corruption.The former presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the last general election in a statement by his media office also accused the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) of deliberately using Nigerian media to promote falsehoods in an attempt to cause acrimony between him and Obasanjo.He said, “The truth is that there is desperation on the part of the current administration to rope in former President Olusegun Obasanjo into a crime as a way of silencing his voice, which they see as the preeminent critical voice against the misrule that they have foisted on Nigerians.”“Atiku stated that for the avoidance of doubt, his son-in-law,  Mallam Babalele Abdullahi, did not donate any money in cash to the Olusegun Obasanjo Library.“He said it is true that Abdullahi facilitated the donation of  N50 million to the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library.“He added that many other individuals, including civic-minded traditional rulers, state governors, bankers and captains of industry also donated to the library."
