 Human rights lawyer and Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Femi Falana, has warned that no investor would put their money in a country where the leadership does not respect the rule of law. He gave the warning at the launch of a book by Professor Pat Utomi titled: ‘Why Not – Citizenship, State Capture, Creeping Fascism and Criminal Hijack of Politics in Nigeria’. Falana said, “You can’t have democracy without the rule of law. Nobody is coming to invest in your country without the rule of law because when you are taking your money to anywhere in the world, you will ask: if there is a breach of contract, will I get my money? Will I get justice in their court? Will it be fast and expeditious? “Now, if you are told that you are likely to get judgment, will they comply with the judgment? If you are told we are not certain, you will move your money elsewhere.” Speaking further, the renowned legal practitioner said that latest calls for a revolution was caused by government’s constant disrespect for the rule of law. He added that more than 2,000 thugs and other miscreants were arrested in Rivers State and other parts of the country during the last general elections but none of them have been brought to court for prosecution more than three months after their arrest. According to him, this is not good for democracy in Nigeria.
