Anxious journalists at Abuja airport to cover El-Zakyzaky's arrival
SaharaReporters Media There was a drama at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport Abuja on Friday as operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) sneaked in the embattled leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN), Ibraheem El-Zakzaky and his wife, Zeenat. He was taken through the Presidential Wing by the operatives, preventing journalists to have any contacts with the couple. Journalists present at the airport were asked to set their cameras at the arrival lounge of the International Wing but were not allowed to see him.Â It was gathered that the officers drove an ambulance to the tarmac with a wheelchair to pick up the detainees. The leader of the sect arrived in the country a few minutes ago after their contentious medical trip to India.
