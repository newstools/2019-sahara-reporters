The United States Consulate in Nigeria has urged local filmmakers and documentary producers to use their skills in telling stories about the African experience especially victims and heroes in the society. Public Affairs Officer of the US Consulate in Lagos, Russell Brooks, made the appeal at the inaugural US Consulate Documentary Film Festival at the Silverbird Galleria, Lagos. Brooks said, “The inaugural US Consulate Documentary Film Festival is an expression of the commitment of the United States to strengthen the ties that links it with Nigeria. “We recognise that we have many common interests and concerns. We are very proud of our engagement with Nigerians in the areas of health, education, economic development, security assistance, and the promotion of democratic institutions. “In Lagos, we are also intimately involved with the creative community. We especially support that community’s efforts to use the power of film, music, dance, or literature to expose society’s ills or celebrate the brilliance and artistry that also form the human experience. “We also hope they will inspire some to explore the means of telling their own stories. “Whether these stories are uplifting or distressing, these are important stories that must be told. “We owe it to the heroes, the victims, we owe it to ourselves.”
