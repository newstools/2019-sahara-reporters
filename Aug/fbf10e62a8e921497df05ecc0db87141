 A court in London, United Kingdom, on Friday gave Process and Industrial Development Limited the permission to seize Nigerian assets worth $9bn. The ruling is the culmination of a case, which started in 2010 when an agreement to build a gas processing plant in Calabar, Cross River State, collapsed between Nigeria and the Irish firm after the former failed to live up to its side of the deal, according to a report byÂ cityam.com. Before Friday's ruling, P&ID had in 2013 won a $6.6bn arbitration case but that figure rose to $9bn when the estimate of what the company could have earned over the course of the 20-year agreement was calculated. The Nigerian Government had tried to nullify the award, insisting that it was not a case to be heard outside its shores but the British judiciary rejected the argument.
