Prof Ango Abdullahi Prof. Ango Abdullahi, a chieftain of the Northern Elders Forum, saysFulani herdsmen are the most hard-working Nigerians though accused asbeing responsible for insecurity in Nigeria.Speaking on Wednesday with journalists in Bauchi, he said, “They havenow become an object of politics, for every bad thing that happens inthe country, now it is Fulani herdsmen. They have forgotten that theFulani herdsmen get nothing from the government.“The Fulani herdsman was better off when the British were here. TheBritish created track roads for Fulani herdsmen created veterinaryclinics for them, created cattle markets and so on for them havingrealized that they contributed significantly to Nigeria’s economyparticularly in the agricultural sector and livestock production.“Look at subsidies that are going to our farmers, you go and check ifyou will find out what subsidy goes to the herdsmen, nothing. You arehaving subsidy for electricity, you are having subsidy for water, youare having subsidy for roads, yet the Fulani herdsman has no subsidywhatsoever and he is the most hard-working Nigerian today but he isnow being maligned as the cause of insecurity.“His animals had been stolen and sold in the city, so when youdeprived him of his animals what do you want him to do? He will behostile.“We should revive all the abandoned cattle routes from Nigerdownwards. There are 600 neglected grazing reserves in northernNigeria alone. What you need to do is to rehabilitate them. I thinkthis is the little you can do for the herdsmen.”
