Executive Chairman of CHRSJ, Comrade Adeniyi Sulaiman, has condemned the continued detention of activist and convener of RevolutionNow movement, Omoyele Sowore, by the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration as a way divert the attention of Nigerians away from government’s incompetence. Sulaiman stated that the country is currently suffering from insecurity and economic meltdown, which President Buhari had failed to attend to. He noted that Sowore did not commit any offence warranting his continue detention, adding that the move was politically motivated and an abuse of power. He said, “The continued detention of Sowore is a diversionary tactics from the incompetence of President Muhammadu Buhari and his government. “The allegations lacked modicum of truth and basis in a sane society of the world. “As a law-abiding and reputable human rights organisations, we would not fold our arms and allow anti-democratic forces and fascist elements pretending to be democrats to subvert the will of Nigerians.” Sulaiman added that 53 groups would be holding a protest against the illegal and continued detention of Sowore and other political prisoners across the country. He stated, “The planned march would draw members from no fewer than 53 organisations across the country and beyond, including artisans, transporters, market men and women, Coalition for Revolution and a host of others. “The protest would commence from Ikeja and end up at the Command Headquarters of the Department of States Services in Shangisha, Lagos, where protest letter would be submitted to the head of the command.”
