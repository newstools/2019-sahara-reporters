The Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai, says the Nigerian Army has performed well in its fight against insurgents and terrorists in Nigeria and urged troops in Maiduguri to be loyal, obedient, and sacrificial in their operational conduct. Buratai stated this during a visit to the 7 Division Medical Services and Hospital, Maiduguri to celebrate Eid-el-Kabir with wounded soldiers. “I must say that so far, we have performed creditably well and I commend all your efforts, though a lot still needs to be done especially in the face of emerging contemporary security challenges," the army chief said. Alluding to the recent clash with policemen in Taraba State, Buratai stated, “We must continue to subordinate ourselves and act professionally in support of civil authorities whenever we are called upon to do so. “That is a veritable way to justify the confidence which Nigerians repose in the Nigerian Army and ensure continued support for the Service. “We must bear in mind that obedience to lawful orders is a hallmark of discipline and discipline remains the bedrock of the military. “Therefore, discipline and courage must remain our watchwords in our personal conduct as well as during operations, as we seek to defeat the remnants of ISWAP threats in the Northeast and security challenges in other parts of our country."
