Former National Security Adviser, Col. Sambo Dasuki (rtd)
SaharaReporters Media The Centre for Anti-Corruption and Open Leadership has hailed the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission for arraigning Mrs Isabella Oshodin over money laundering to the tune of N22.9bn. Oshodin was said to have received the money from the Office of former National Security Adviser, Col. Sambo Dasuki (retd). CACOL in a statement by its Media and Publications Officer, Toyin Odofin, on Monday, described the move by the anti-graft agency as “heart-lifting”. Odofin said, “It is heart-lifting that after many years that Nigerian dignitaries involved in the fraudulent distribution of money meant to purchase security equipment for the country are now being arraigned. “But unless emphasis shifts from severity of punishment to certainty of detention in criminal offences, the fight against corruption would remain mere hallucination.” CACOL stated that while capital punishment should not be employed, offenders must not go unpunished irrespective of political standings and economic status.
