He said, “I'm excited to announce my rematch with Anthony Joshua. In the first fight, I made history and became the first-ever Mexican/American heavyweight champion of the world. I am grateful to Saudi Arabia for inviting me. “I took it to AJ in ‘The Big Apple’ and I'm looking forward to ending his career in the desert. Don't miss this fight!”
