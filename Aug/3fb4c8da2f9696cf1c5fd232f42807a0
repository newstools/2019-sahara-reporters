German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Sunday said that the European Union was ready for whatever out come the exit of Britain from the union would bring. British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is seeking to persuade European Union leaders to reopen Brexit talks or face the prospect of its second-largest member leaving abruptly on October 31 with no deal in place to mitigate the economic shock, according to a report by Reuters. Merkel said, “We are prepared for any outcome, we can say that, even if we do not get an agreement. “But at all events, I will make an effort to find solutions – up until the last day of negotiations. “I think it’s always better to leave with an agreement than without one. “But if that’s not possible, we’ll be prepared for the alternative as well.’’
