Popular social networking platform, Twitter, has apologised to Nigerian activist, Aisha Yesufu, for blocking her account on August 29, 2019. Yesufu, who is a co-convener of the Bring Back Our Girls Movement, was unable to access her Twitter account, which she uses to criticise the Nigerian Government earlier. However, on Thursday, Yesufu shared an email from Twitter, claiming the action was a "mix up". The tweet reads, “Thank you everyone for your voices. I have gotten a mail from @Twitterand I am back.
