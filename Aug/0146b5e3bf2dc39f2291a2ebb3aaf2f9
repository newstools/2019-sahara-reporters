Agba Jalingo My constant assertion that Cross River state governor, Senator Ben Ayade isa threat to free speech and a free press in Cross River state has beenchallenged by some of his aides who also want me to prove my allegationwith facts. The thing about this administration is that, in the same mannerthey make and forget promises so quickly, they also forget very quickly howoften the Ayade government has attempted to stifle free speech and freepress since he assumed office.Before his ascension, my experience as a reporter in Cross River state,under Governor Liyel Imoke also recorded some breaches but generally, themedia in the State had a wider space to practice their trade. Imoke metwith the Press regularly and took questions with equanimity, no matter howupsetting the questions were.The Imoke administration bullied and intimidated and persecuted amedical practitioner, Doctor Elihu Osim, who accused Imoke's wife ofchild trafficking. He was later charged in a trumped-up allegation.Governor Imoke also dragged Chief Okoi Obono Obla and ThisDayCorrespondent, Bassey Inyang to court over a publication he said waslibellous.But there was no reported incident of violent aggression towards citizensor journalists in the State for expressing their views or for writing mediareports.But Imoke had a deputy, Efiok Cobham, with a different temperament. In2013, CrossRiverWatch did a report about the former Deputy Governor thatreally got him upset and he publicly threatened to kill Agba Jalingo anddestroy CrossRiverWatch over that report. A combined team of securityagents were sent to arrest the then editor of CrossRiverWatch, EmmanuelUnah, from his home at midnight and he was detained at the policeheadquarters in Calabar until Governor Imoke who was seeking medical helpin the US intervened and sought his release against the will of his deputywho was an acting governor at the time.On his return, Imoke openly cautioned Cobham in exco and warned him toallow the press to do their work and not to create any further riftbetween his government and journalists in the State and it appearsthat caution was taken seriously. Such incidents stopped until the endof their tenure.When Ayade resumed office, the situation began to change. The regularmedia interactions with the governor were the first casualty. Unlikewhat obtains before Ayade, this governor has held only two meetingswith the Press in four and a half years he has been in office.The first meeting which was very early in his administration, brokedown after journalists asked him questions he called 'beer parlour'questions. He swore never to meet 'those idiots' again.The second meeting was hurriedly called after the EFCC arrested thegovernor's younger brother, Frank Ayade, in 2017. Once the governorknew the information had leaked to the media, he requested for ameeting which was essentially to manage the situation.Under Imoke, apart from closed-door sessions, correspondents were allallowed in exco to witness sittings and signing of partnerships andMoUs.Governor Ayade has rather created his own coterie of 'friendly press"who are the only ones now allowed to cover his activities, while theCPS sends press releases to editors. You stay in that 'friendly press'at the pleasure of the governor. He has expelled those consideredcritical. The media is being dictated to, how to cover the governor,if not, you are kicked out. And then the constant attacks onindividuals and the media forexpressing dissenting views has spiked, compared to the past.A former lecturer in UNICAL and critic of the Ayade government, Joseph Odokwas the first casualty early into the administration. He was attacked andstabbed at Zanzibar in Calabar by persons it turned out were sent bygovernment functionaries according to Police investigation. The matter wastransferred from Calabar to Abuja, where the Chief of Staff to theGovernor, Martin Orim, former State Security Adviser, Jude Ngaji and aformer Director in the State Green Sheriff, nicknamed Defense, were allfingered and invited for questioning in Abuja, in a case that was profiledas attempted assassination by the Police. There is still pendinginvestigation ongoing in the matter.Ifere Paul, another popular critic of the Ayade administration, wasnext to follow. On the instigation of the governor via a complaint bythe formerState Attorney General, Joe Abang, the Police abducted Ifere from Abuja,drove him in a truck from Abuja to Calabar in chains, before he was chargedby the Cross River state government for allegedly writing things onFacebook that are capable of inciting the public against thegovernment. The court has since thrown out the charge.Publisher of Fearlessreports.com, Inyali Peter was also physicallyattacked, beaten and wounded in Obudu in 2018 by appointees of theAyade government for allegedly writing and publishing things againstthe government. Inyali petitioned the Police and named his attackersbut the matter was swept under the carpet because of those involved.Former CrossRiverWatch government house correspondent, Jonathan Ugbal,government house information officer, Nakanda Amboni Iyadim and a youthcorper from Taraba state that was serving in the government house, werearrested in 2018, after CrossRiverWatch published photographs ofCommissioners sleeping in exco chambers while waiting for thegovernor. The trio were taken to the Police headquarters, Diamond HillCalabar, wherethey were intimidated, harassed and their privacy was violated with theirphones and cameras searched without a warrant, in a bid to find whotransmitted the photos to CrossRiverWatch. They were detained and laterreleased on bail without a charge.The recent arrest, detention and subsequent arraignment of CrossRiverWatchManaging Editor, Jeremiah Archibong and News Editor, Jonathan Ugbal forshowing up at a scheduled event to do their job, is also being instigatedby the Chief of Staff to the governor of Cross River state on orders fromthe boss.And then the latest attempt by the governor to whip CrossRiverWatchinto submission. The invitation by the Police over an article inCrossRiverWatch, is an attempt to criminalize a civil matter, all in a bidto please one man who doesn't want to be challenged, regardless of hisdecisions. This is the reality that we have to contend with in Cross Riverstate, in the days of Ayade.But this is an exercise in futility. It is an expression of innatepanic and insecurity that the leader is battling with. The media hasnever been a problem. Citizen's perceptions, opinions or what theywrite has never been the problem. Government has always been theproblem. The desire of the government to control; to control both themedia and the people. To stifle their voices and run the State alone.That has always been the problem. But a leader with a good sense ofhistory will know that no leader ever won any of these battles. Thepeople own the government. They always win andthe media stands to watch and tell the story.The media in our State will not allow this government to silence us.We will fight, not only for ourselves but for democracy, for freespeech, for the right to hold our government accountable. We will risein unison and solidarity and tell not just the Ayade government butevery other government that comes after this one, that the pen ismightier than your guns and security apparatchiks. That we have comeof age and we can holdthem accountable for the decisions they make on our behalf.For governor Ayade, you can bruise us while you reign but you can't win us.You got only 1374 days to roar, but we will still be here to tell ourstories.Yours Sincerely,Citizen Agba Jalingo.#1374DaysToGo#HoldYourLeadersAccountable#FollowOurMoney#LeadersAreServantsNotMasters#NoToUncompletedProjects#AyadeMustWork#AyadeMustSucceed#AyadeLegacy#100DaysIn2ndTerm
