The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has warned of more flood disasters in Lagos and other neighbouring states. The spokesman for NEMA, Ibrahim Farinloye, stated this during a NEMA retreat for its staff in Abeokuta. He warned that Nigerians should expect a high volume of rainfall next month. According to him, Nigeria will experience more flood disasters in Lagos and neighbouring states. Farinloye added that the agency had sent letters to the state governors calling their attention to the expected flood disasters. “Go to Lagos and other neighbouring states and you will see that the drainage has been filled with refuse and other wastes. "Therefore, if the rain begins, there is no how we won’t record a flood disaster," he explained. Speaking further, he noted, “The state and local governments are responsible for the expanding of the drainage, which is why the director-general (of NEMA) had sent letters to all of them (governors), calling their attention to it, and they had all shown interest. "As we expect more rain this year, parents should be very careful with their children. When you see that the rain is about to fall, it is better for you don't allow your children to go anywhere for that period. Motorists should also drive carefully while plying the roads.”
