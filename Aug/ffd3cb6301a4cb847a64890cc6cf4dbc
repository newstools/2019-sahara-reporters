  The Kogi State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria has said that it had not endorsed any aspirant or party for the November 16 governorship election in the state. Chairman of the organisation in the state, Dr John Ibenu, made the disclosure at the end of a meeting in Lokoja, the state capital, on Monday. Ibenu said, “CAN is a spiritual and religious organisation, and not a political organisation. “All our members belong to as many political parties of their choices and they are free to do so. “CAN is a father body to all political parties, and so cannot and should not adopt any political party in any election (unless it is compelled to do so and must be the decision of an emergency plenary). “CAN has not adopted any candidate, every member is encouraged to join the political party of his or her choice. CAN is open to all.” The body however, added that any political party that needed and demanded its support must be committed to the fear of God; ensure peace and unity of polity; justice, equity and fairness to all.
