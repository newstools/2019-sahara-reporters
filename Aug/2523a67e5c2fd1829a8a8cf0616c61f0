George Akume Senator Emmanuel Yisa Orker-Jev has begun the defence of the case against him at the election petition tribunal. Senator George Akume of the All Progressives Congress dragged Orker-Jev of the Peoples Democratic Party before the tribunal, alleging that the election was marred by malpractice. Orker-Jev, who had defeated Akume during the election, presented five witnesses at the tribunal to testify for him. The witnesses were cross-examined by the legal team of the former governor led by Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Ishaq Dikko. The tribunal upheld as substantiated all evidences of the third witness as he was tried under cross-examination. Chairman of the tribunal, Justice R.O. Odugu, adjourned the case to Friday, August 16, 2019, when the respondent will be expected to close his defense.
