The Centre for Anti-Corruption and Open Leadership has called on the government, the National Assembly and those in charge of Police Trust Fund to do something about the dilapidated state of police barracks across the country. In a statement by the organisation’s Media Officer, Toyin Odofin, on behalf of the Executive Chairman, Debo Adeniran, CACOL said, “Police barracks across the country are gradually trudging towards danger. “Some policemen live in poorly equipped and dilapidated barracks, while majority live among the civilians in low level rented apartment without basic amenities. “In most cases, the barracks have been converted to offices as a result of inadequate office space. “This situation tends to affect the general morale of the police and also the performance level. “However, the level of unabashed neglect is disheartening and disgusting, ranging from dilapidated buildings, stinking gutters, shabby electric wiring, broken staircases, broken doors and shattered windows, torn roofs, and rusty balconies etc. “The barracks could pass for rat holes and slums and yet officers reside in them. “Meanwhile, it is unfortunate that the people at the helm of affairs have been siphoning the money meant for the project for their own personal use. “We aver that government should adhere to the call of the Nigerian Police Force on the state of their dilapidated barracks. “Also, efforts should be made to build more barracks and provide accommodation for policemen which will enhance their productivity.”
