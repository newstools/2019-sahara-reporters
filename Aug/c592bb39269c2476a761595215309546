  Director-General of the National Youth Service Corps, Brig-Gen Shaibu Ibrahim, has advised female corps members not to allow men lead them into acts that bring shame to their families. Ibrahim gave the admonition on Monday in Zamfara State when he visited Batch B corps members, Stream 2, at the NYSC Orientation Camp in Tsafe Local Government Area of the state. He said, “My call to you female corps members is that you should respect yourselves and maintain your dignity. “You should not allow men during the service year to lead you into activities that will bring shame to your families and the NYSC scheme. “As corps members, you should desist from unauthorised journeys to avoid being vulnerable to security challenges and accidents. “Most of the reports of corps members’ deaths during the service year is as a result of auto crashes.”
