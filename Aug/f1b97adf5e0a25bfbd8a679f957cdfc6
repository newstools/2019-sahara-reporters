Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, has asked political leaders representing the Igbos to take the attack of Ike Ekwremadu in Germany as a polite warning. Ekwremadu, former Deputy Senate President, was beaten by some angry Igbos, who accused him of selling the rights and entitlement of people from the region to the Fulanis, according to a report by PUNCH. Ekweremadu, who confirmed the attack, said he was to give a keynote address along with the President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Nnia Nwodo, but was attacked by some people l, who identified themselves as Biafra. Commenting on the attack, Kanu, who tweeted via his personal Twitter handle @MaziNnamdiKanu on Sunday, described the act as “courageous”, adding that other Igbo leaders should see the attack as a warning. He said, “The courageous act by IPOB at Nürnberg, Germany, is a polite warning to those engaged in selling our collective interest to Fulani caliphate. "Nwodo, Igbo govs are warned."
