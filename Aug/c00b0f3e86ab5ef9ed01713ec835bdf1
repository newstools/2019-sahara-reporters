  A middle-aged man believed to be a ritualist was allegedly set ablaze by an angry mob on Monday at Koso Community Grammar School, Iseyin Local Government Area in Oyo State. An eyewitness, who spoke to Sahara Reporters said that the suspect was caught with human feaces, which many ritualists were said to be using to make money. He said the suspect was unlucky when the mob descended on him and was beaten to a stupor. He added that the mob decided to take laws into their hand as they set fire on him, leading to pandemonium in the area. He said the area has been deserted for fear of arrest by the police. It was gathered that two other suspected ritualists were killed in the town last week including a pregnant woman for a similar offence. There have been several reports on the menace of ritual killings in the town as people die in mysterious circumstances.
