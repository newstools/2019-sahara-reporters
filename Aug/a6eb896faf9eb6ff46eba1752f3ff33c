 As the international community watched events unfold in Hong Kong gripped by large-scale anti-government protests for more than four months, Hongkongers are flocking Pastor TB Joshua's Synagogue Church Of All Nations (SCOAN), reports Regionweek. According to the news platform, despite the protests, there was an influx of Hongkongers into Lagos heading for Ikotun-Egbe where T.B. Joshua's church is located. "Within the last two months, a worker at Nigeria’s Murtala Mohammed Airport estimated that over 100 had flown in from Hong Kong to visit the popular church for religious tourism", Gareth Watson, a South Africa-based journalist claimed. Watson added: "Indeed, according to Nigeria’s Immigration Service, of every 10 international visitors entering Nigeria, six are bound for the SCOAN." T.B. Joshua is known to be familiar with African leaders like the late Atta Mills, Joyce Banda, George Weah, and John Magafuli.
