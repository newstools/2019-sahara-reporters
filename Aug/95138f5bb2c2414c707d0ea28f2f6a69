Former Super Eagles coach, Samson Siasia, has said that his team of lawyers are currently working to appeal a ban slammed on him by FIFA on Friday. The world football governing body had on Friday placed a life ban on the ex-Nantes of France striker for alleged match fixing. Siasia, who made the disclosure on Saturday, said that he was hopeful of a positive conclusion to the matter. In a statement on Friday, FIFA said that its adjudicatory chamber of independent Ethics Committee found Siasia guilty of the offence.
