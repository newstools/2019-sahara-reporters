Aisha Yesufu Rights activist and co-convener of the Bring Back Our Girls Movement, Aisha Yesufu, has described President Muhammadu Buhari as the worse person to occupy leadership position in Nigeria. Describing him as a "colossal failure", Yesufu said no amount of sycophancy around the President will change his lack of leadership capacity. In a tweet on Saturday, she said, “Muhammadu Buhari @MBuhari is colossal failure and no amount of sycophancy will take that away. “He is becoming the worst man that ever occupied the seat of leadership in Nigeria. “As Commander-in-Chief, he gives failure a new meaning. His state isn't secured let alone the nation!”
