  Two medical doctors and 15 others are still in the captivity of kidnappers in Taraba State, Sahara Reporters have found. A group, Southern Taraba Youth Forum, is accusing a rival Tiv youth group from Benue State of being behind the act. A Principal Medical Officer at Takum General Hospital, Dr Sule Audu with two of his children, are among 17 people yet to be released by their abductors after collecting various sums of money as ransom. At a briefing with journalists, a member of Southern Taraba Youth Forum, Dodo Danlamia, issued an ultimatum for the Tiv militia to reopen access ways blocked in the aftermath of the recent Jukun/Tiv clash. He said, “We are giving the Tiv seven days to reopen the roads from Wukari to Takum, Wukari to Donga, Takum to Katsina-Ala, Donga to Mararaba, Wukari-Kente and Wukari-Tsokundi, which have crippled economic and agricultural activities of the areas. “At the end of this ultimatum, we will be left with no other option than to conclude that the Tiv are not ready for peace.” Spokesperson for the Taraba Police Command, David Misal, when contacted on the matter could not confirm the situation. He promised to get back to our correspondent with more facts but had yet to do so as at the time of filing this report.
