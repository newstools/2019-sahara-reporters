The Embassy of Nigeria, Berlin, Germany, has said it would swiftly identify and punish members of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra believed to have attacked former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, in Nuremberg, Germany, on Saturday. In a statement on Monday, the embassy said the organisers had reportedly requested for police protection but were told that the threat level was minimal and did not require the stationing of any personnel at the venue before the incident. The embassy added that it would move against the IPOB and its members to deter any reoccurrence of such incidence. The statement reads, “The Embassy has requested a thorough investigation of this attack with a view to identifying the perpetrators and bringing them swiftly to justice in accordance with German laws.
