At least 15 people said to be members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) have been arrested by the Nigeria Police Force in Amasiri, Afikpo North local government area of Ebonyi State. A spokesperson for the police in Ebonyi, Loveth Odah, the 15 were arrested at their convention ground in Amasiri. According to the police, the arrest was made after receiving a report that some secessionist groups planned to hold a two-day convention in the state. “The Ebonyi State police command in active collaboration with other security agencies in the state, while acting on credible intelligence report that IPOB/MASSOB/BIM members will have their 2019 convention in the state, on 13 and 14 August 2019, embarked on a massive 'show of force' covering the entire length and breadth of the state with particular focus on identified flashpoints. “The exercise dominated the entire state and frustrated the activities of IPOB/MASSOB/BIM members thereby denying them the opportunity to hold their meeting in the pre-arranged venue. “They were, however, traced to a hideout in the bush around Amasiri, Afikpo North L.G.A of the state where 15 members led by one Rev. Ogbonna Nnachi, ‘M’, about 70 years of age were arrested. “Items recovered from them include Biafra currency (two pounds), branded Biafra T-shirts, caps and bangles.”
