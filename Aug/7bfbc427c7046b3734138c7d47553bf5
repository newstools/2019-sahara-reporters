The Zamfara State Government has announced the removal of the Emir of Maru, Alhaji Abubakar Cika, and the District Head of Kanoma, Alhaji Ahmed Kanoma, for conniving with bandits to terrorise their subjects. Their removal was conveyed in a letter signed by the deputy governor of the state, Mahdi Ali-Gusau, in Gusau, the capital, on Saturday. The two traditional heads were suspended in June and an investigation committee headed by former Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Abubakar, set up to verify the allegations against them. The committee however, submitted its findings earlier this week, which indicted the duo. The government said, “The two monarchs were found wanting and have really committed the offences levelled against them by their subjects. “As such, the state government has no option than to remove them to serve as deterrent to others.”
