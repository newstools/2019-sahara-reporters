The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has revealed that its ongoing investigation of Mrs. Winifred Oyo-Ita, Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, was prompted after it received intelligence information about her.The anti-graft agency said this to dispel claims that investigation was instigated by President Muhammadu Buhari's Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari.The EFCC in a statement on Monday stated that its investigations are always evidence-based and always triggered by petitions or intelligence.“For the avoidance of doubt, investigation by the EFCC is evidence-based. Most often,they are triggered by petitions or intelligence. In the case of the HoS (head of service), Oyo-Ita's investigation, it was prompted by intelligence received by the commission,” the EFCC explained.It added that the EFCC is an independent agency created by law to fight corruption without fear or favour.“In the discharge of its mandate, the commission does not take instructions from extraneous bodies neither will it lend itself to be used to settle scores by anyone.“The commission again wishes to appeal to the media to be circumspect in their reportage and not lend themselves to actions that could befuddle the activities of the commission,” the statement added.
