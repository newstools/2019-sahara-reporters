THISDAY A federal high court in Abuja has granted permission to the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) to freeze various sums of money in bank accounts traced to the former governor of Zamfara State, Abdul’aziz Abubakar Yari.Justice Taiwo Taiwo gave the permission on Friday when he ruled on an ex parte motion filed by ICPC ordering that all the accounts containing $669, 248.89 and N24.3 million, domiciled with Polaris and Zenith banks respectively, be frozen.The monies are funds allegedly stashed in the personal accounts of the former governor and companies belonging to him, which include Kayatawa Nigeria Limited and B. T. Oil and Gas Nigeria Limited.A breakdown shows that the sum of N12, 912, 848.68 was stashed in the former governor’s Zenith Bank account; N11, 159, 674.17 found in a Zenith bank account operated by Kayatawa and N217, 388.04 also in Zenith Bank belonging to B.T.
