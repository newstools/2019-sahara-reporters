The Federal High Court Abuja will on Monday deliver its ruling in a suit seeking to stop President Muhammadu Buhari from inaugurating the 43 ministerial nominees over the exclusion of a Federal Capital Territory indigene from the list, the News Agency of Nigeria reports. The applicant, Mr Musa Baba-panya, who was also the counsel in the case, had on Thursday approached the court with an ex-parte motion, asking it to stop President Buhari from going ahead with the inauguration. Baba-panya, who is also an indigene of Karu in the FCT, said the President’s action was contrary to an Appeal Court judgment delivered on March 15, 2018. President Buhari is the 1st defendant, while the Attorney General of the Federation is the 2nd defendant in the case. The lawyer in his suit, said, “The 43 confirmed ministerial appointees now awaiting swearing-in or inauguration as the Federal Executive Council is incomplete, illegal, unconstitutional, null, void and of no effect whatsoever. “The 1st defendant stands in contempt of law and court for his brazen refusal to comply with the tenor of the Abuja Division of Court of Appeal judgment of 15/1/2018 compelling him to the immediate and forthwith appointment off an indigene of FCT, Abuja, as minister of the federation. “Allowing the President to go on with his decision would mean that he is going to constitute an illegal cabinet.” Justice Taiwo Taiwo ordered that the suit should commence during the vacation period of the court.
