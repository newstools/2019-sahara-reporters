The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has described Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi as deluded and misguided in proscribing the group in the hope that he will be picked as the presidential running mate of Bola Tinubu in 2023. The group also said Igbo governors, from Nigeria's South-east, were "fooling themselves". “Dave Umahi’s desperate attempt to turn our beloved Ebonyi State into another vassal state is dead on arrival. “IPOB is on the ground and will never allow it. If his ‘Alice in Wonderland’ dream of becoming Bola Tinubu’s running mate in the 2023 presidential election is his motivation for coming out against IPOB at this critical moment in our history, then he is not only misguided but deluded," the secessionist organization said in a statement on Tuesday. Its spokesman, Emma Powerful, pointed out that it was not the first time Umahi had sought to "impress his masters by making grand declarations" against IPOB. “Sometime in mid-2017 he issued a fatwa against our leader and boasted that IPOB’s rallies would never hold in Ebonyi State,” Powerful claimed. “How many Fulani governors have come out against herdsmen or Boko Haram? Yet Igbo governors keep on making a complete fool of themselves by attacking IPOB."
