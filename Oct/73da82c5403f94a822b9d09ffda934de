ChannelsTV A Nigerian lawyer and rights activist, Frank Tietie, claims theNigerian government has no forensic evidence to prove that formerChairman of the Pension Reform Task Team, Abdulrasheed Maina, stoleany money.“There is no forensic evidence to prove that Maina stole moneydirectly,” the lawyer told ChannelsTV on Wednesday.Tietie stated, “All of those forces who have always wanted him, whohave always been scared of him would now come and face him and heshould be given the opportunity to say the whole truth.“Maina definitely has enjoyed some measure of cooperation from thestate authorities in such a confusing manner.“At a point he was declared wanted, only to be reported to beprotected by the DSS.”Maina was declared wanted by the EFCC for an alleged N2 billion fraudin November 2015 that led to his disappearance only to show up againin October 2017 as he was reinstated as a director in the Ministry ofInterior.His reinstatement and promotion led to public outrage.In an interview with ChannelsTV, after his return, Maina had said,“Mr. President, I will give you information and documents that willfetch you over N3 trillion now in Nigeria, give me nine months. Withinthe first three months, I will show you N1 trillion just like I showedyou N1 trillion in this 2017."Tietie, on the other hand, said, “I think he was reinstated as bait,in order to allow him to release all of those sensitive information hehas, to bust corruption,” he added.
