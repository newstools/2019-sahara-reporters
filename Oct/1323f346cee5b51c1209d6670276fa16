Rights activists under the aegis of Concerned Nigerians Group on Thursday marched to the National Human Rights Commission, Abuja, to protest what they describe as gross human rights violations by the Nigerian military in recent times. The group said it was concerned at the increasing presence and use of military force in a civilian administration, leading to numerous cases of abuse. The group led by Deji Adeyanju said, “We are worried that the Nigerian Army, saddled with the responsibility of protecting our territorial integrity and ensuring peace among warring parties, had become obviously partisan, undermining decades of reputation built as a professional military body. “Due to several reports and complaints that our organisation had received since 2015 on the reckless activities of some surveillance contractors to oil firms in Bayelsa, many of whom are military personnel, we are asking that soldiers should not be deployed for the conduct of election in that state or anywhere else. “We urge the NHRC not to wait until people’s rights are violated before it acts, and it must be proactive and involved in ensuring that the peoples of Bayelsa and Kogi vote without any form of interference and intimidation.”
