The Islamic Movement in Nigeria has asked the National Human Rights Commission to prevail on the police to release the 12 bodies of its members killed during the July 22, 2019 protest to their families. The group while staging a protest at the head office of the commission on Wednesday in Abuja, accused the police of gross violation of fundamental human rights of their victims. IMN said the police had refused to release the bodies of the victims to their families 72 days after despite efforts by the bereaved families. The group also demanded the release of 63 protesters arrested on July 22 by the police at the Federal Secretariat, Abuja, during the free #FreeZakyzaky protest. In a statement, Secretary of the Academic Forum of the Movement, Abdullahi Musa, said, “We wish to inform you that the police is still withholding 12 corpses of free-Zakzaky protesters killed by them in Abuja on July 22, 2019. “Therefore, we demand for the release of all the withheld corpses as well as the freedom of our brothers and sisters being detained by the police. “Also, we reiterate our demand for the unconditional release of our leader, Sheikh Ibraheem El-Zakzaky and his wife, Zeenah.”
