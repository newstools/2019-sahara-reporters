Ayuba Wabba, the President of the Nigerian Labour Congress has urgedthe President Muhammadu Buhari regime not to increase personal incometax, electricity tariff and prices of petroleum products afteragreeing on minimum wage for all levels of workers.The government reached a consensus on the implementation of the newminimum wage on Friday after long hours of consultation between theparties.A resolution was finally reached early yesterday when labour accepteda 23.2 percent salary increase for workers on level 07; 20 percent forthose on level 08; 19 percent for level 09; 16 percent for levels 10to 14 and 14 percent for levels 15 to 17.Reacting to the agreement, the labour union president described thesigning of the agreement as a victory for Nigerian workers.He said: “We want to thank all Nigerian workers and our affiliatedunions for their support, solidarity, and unity of purpose throughoutthe difficult negotiations. It is heartwarming that the process waseventually rewarding.”We must say that, as always, we were disappointed by the antics ofthose whose interest lies elsewhere than the common goal of protectingand advancing the interest of ordinary Nigerian workers.“We wish to emphasize that the hard-won salary adjustment will benefitall categories of workers including those in the military andpara-military services. Apart from workers, the recent salary increasewill also benefit ordinary citizens, especially those in the informalsector as the increase in the available disposable income of workerswill translate into a stronger purchasing power for our people.“This will however only be sustainable if traders and providers ofessential services refrain from artificial inflation of the prices ofgoods and services. It makes more sense to sell more at a stable pricethan sell little or nothing at inflated prices. Certainly, we havelearnt from our past mistakes that inflation of prices with adjustmentin salaries is a roulette game in which the downtrodden masses are thevictims.“We also call on the government to refrain from introducingcounter-productive economic policies and decisions that would erodethe recent wage gain achieved by workers. Any further increase in theprices of petroleum products, electricity tariffs, and personal incometaxes would amount to collecting with the left hand what is given toworkers with the right hand. The leadership of organized labour willresist such a move.”Arising from our successful negotiation with the federal government,it is expected that all employers of labour in the public sector mustensure that all the necessary formalities for a smooth implementationof the negotiated salaries based on the new national minimum wage arecarried out with immediate effect.”While commending state governments that have already commencedimplementation of the new national minimum wage, we urge that theimplementation should be a product of collective bargaining process inline with ILO Convention 98 on Organizing and Collective Bargaining.”Furthermore, all employers of labour in the thirty-six states of thefederation and the Federal Capital Territory, as well as the organizedprivate sector, are expected to complete the implementation process ofthe new national minimum wage and consequential wage adjustmentforthwith.”State councils of the Nigeria Labour Congress are hereby directed tooffer leadership and work harmoniously with the TUC and JNPSNC and allunions to ensure effective implementation of the new national minimumwage and the consequential salary adjustment that must be reachedthrough a process of collective bargaining.”
