The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has slammed the MuslimRights Concern (MURIC) over comment suggesting people are “kidnappingfor Christ”Ishaq Akintola, director of MURIC, had condemned the kidnap of ninechildren from Kano State. In his condemnation, the MURIC leader hadsaid: “kidnapping for Christ is disgusting, nauseating, wicked andreprehensible.”Reacting to this statement, Joseph Hayab, chairman of CAN in thenorthern region, condemned Akintola’s statement, stating thatcriminality abounds in every religion.He said: “Criminals abound everywhere and in every religion, for MURICto say a crime was perpetrated for Christ, is sheer mischief aimed atprovoking Christians,” he said.“How could a rational, sane and educated person, associate the actionof criminals to a religion? There are many instances where Christiangirls were abducted, forcefully converted to Islam and married off bycriminals in Northern Nigeria. In some of these cases, the police either refused to act or turned blind eyes.“Will it be right to accuse all Muslims of the action of suchcriminals? The answer is no.“A particular group which belongs to a particular religious group hasalways been alleged to be responsible for the rampant kidnappings andbanditry across the country, especially in the north, will it be rightto say that they are committing the crime to promote their tribe orreligion?“We also have the case of Leah Sharibu who is still being held by BokoHaram insurgents for refusing to denounce her Christian faith andconvert to Islam. No Christian has associated Muslims with suchcriminal acts.“If we have any witness against the culprits behind the abduction, wewill join hands with the people of Kano to testify against him or themin court,” he said.“There is nothing like kidnapping for Christ. This evil kidnapper orchild trafficker, knowing that he did not carry away the children forreligion gave them new tribal names, MURIC should note.“CAN northern states, therefore, condemned anybody carrying people'schildren away and supports security agencies to investigate the matterand prosecute the culprits. The abduction of children is a criminaloffence. MURIC can call whoever is found doing that whatever name theylike, but don’t associate criminality with Christ.”
