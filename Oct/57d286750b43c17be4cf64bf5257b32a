We reaffirm that weare fully committed to working with Nigerian authorities and welcomean open dialogue to clarify any concerns they may have about NGOs."Mobilising more local action to better serve the communities isimperative, and INGOs are increasingly investing resources to supporttheir local and national counterparts."Through a press release from the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs,Disaster Management and Social Development, INGOs are pleased with theannouncement that Action Against Hunger (AAH) and Mercy Corpssuspension of operations that has been ongoing for over a month hasnow been temporarily lifted. This will ensure that life-savingactivities can soon resume."All member organizations provide necessary reports and remainaccountable to the established systems and processes. INGOs alsoimplement mitigation measures, including eligibility and compliancechecks, internal controls for tenders, segregation of duties, assetverification, authority approval procedures, periodic internal andexternal audits, and engage community feedback mechanisms."INGOs also engage in the existing civilian-military coordinationmechanisms and notification procedures for cash, staff and cargomovements with the relevant bodies."INGOs remain committed to upholding the humanitarian principles ofhumanity, neutrality, impartiality, independence, internationalhumanitarian law as well as Nigerian legislation so that life-savingassistance will continue to reach the most vulnerable populations in atimely, efficient and effective way," he said.During his two-day visit to Nigeria, International NGOs met with theUnited Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs andEmergency Relief Coordinator, Mark Lowcock, to discuss ways tocontinue an effective and efficient response in challengingcircumstances.This year alone, INGOs along with other stakeholders including thegovernment, UN, national and local civil society have providedcritical and life-saving assistance to almost 3.8 million civiliansmost affected by the 10-year conflict.More than 2.1 million people have been reached with food assistance,and some 187,360 severely malnourished children were treated infacilities supported by government and humanitarian organizations. Thehumanitarian community has responded to rapid and multipledisplacements, ensuring that the lives and dignity of the vulnerablepopulation can continue to be provided for.While development efforts in the north-east are absolutely necessary,and to which we have been committed to in Adamawa, Yobe and parts ofBorno states, the context in other parts of Borno state necessitatespopulations to receive lifesaving assistance. Over 140,000people havebeen forced to flee in Borno so far this year, most of whom requiredrapid humanitarian assistance.
