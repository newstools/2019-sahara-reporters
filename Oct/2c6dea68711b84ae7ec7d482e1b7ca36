gettyimages Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder of Facebook, sides with BernieSanders, Democratic presidential candidate, that no single individualdeserves to be a billionaire.Last September, the 2020 US presidential candidate made a declarativestatement about billionaires during an interview with The New YorkTimes, saying: "I don't think that billionaires should exist."Sanders was explaining his plans for a wealth tax and a NationalWealth Registry."This proposal does not eliminate billionaires, but it eliminates alot of the wealth that billionaires have, and I think that's exactlywhat we should be doing," he added.Reacting to this during a question and answer session with staff ofFacebook, at the company's headquarters in California, Zukerbergagreed that no one should have that much money.He said: “I understand where he’s coming from. I don’t know if I havean exact threshold on what amount of money someone should have but onsome level, no one deserves to have that much money.”“I think that if you do something that is good, you should getrewarded. But I do think that some of the wealth that can beaccumulated is unreasonable."
