Former Vice President of Nigeria, Atiku Abubakar, has called on the government to deal decisively with university lecturers in the habit of sexually harassing young female undergraduates for grades. Atiku’s call followed a documentary by the BBC where two lecturers were caught on tape soliciting sex from students in return for favours in the University of Ghana and the University of Lagos. One of the lecturers, Boniface Igbeneghu, from the Department of European Languages at Unilag, was caught on camera making sexual demands to offer admission to a supposed 17-year-old girl.
