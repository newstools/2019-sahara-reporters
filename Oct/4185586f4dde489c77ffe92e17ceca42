 An appeal court in Abuja on Friday has upheld the decision of the election petitions tribunal that nullified the election of Senator Dino Melaye. Melaye was representing Kogi West until the sacking. The court affirmed the ruling of the tribunal and, therefore, nullified the election of Melaye of the Peoples Democratic Party. The Independent National Electoral Commission is to conduct fresh elections within 90 days from today.
