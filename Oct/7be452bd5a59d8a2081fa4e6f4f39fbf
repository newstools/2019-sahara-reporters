The Nigerian Senate has picked up the abandoned sexual harassment bill sponsored by Ovie Omo-Agege during the eighth assembly, according to a report by Premium Times. The action follows the outrage that trailed the undercover investigation by BBC Africa Eye on Monday where university lecturers demanding sex from female undergraduates were exposed. The bill titled: “Sexual Harassment in Tertiary Education Institution Prohibition Bill”, is aimed at checking sexual misconducts among lecturer towards their students. The bill prescribes a five-year jail term for lecturers and educators convicted for sexual harassment of their male or female students. The bill also recommended expulsion or suspension for students whose claims of being serially abused by lecturers or educators are found to be false by any competent court. Another provision of the bill is a fine of N5m in the event that the accused person is convicted by a competent court of law.
