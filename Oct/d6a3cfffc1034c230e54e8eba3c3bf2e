The entertainment industry is emerging as the market that will absorbmuch of the loans the central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is forcingcommercial banks to give.A report by Proshare indicates that banks are positioning themselvesto attract clients from small and medium scale enterprises in themusic and movie space.However, analysts Sahara Reporters have spoken to and reportspublished by financial research firms, conclude that the increasedpressure on banks to lend much of their deposit, is negative for thefinance industry at this point.“We believe this development — the 65 percent loan to deposit ratio islargely negative for the banking sector, which has only just recoveredfrom the weak asset quality issues prevalent since 2016,”Cardinalstone research said in a report.“We also believe that the macro-environment is still too fragile tosupport strong growth in lending,” it added.Adedayo Bakare, an analyst with Afrinvest gave Sahara Reporters asimilar outlook. He said tier one banks – the most stable lenders, donot operate a banking model that allows them to give loans tocustomers that are highly likely not to pay back.This, however, are the type of customers the CBN wants the banks totarget. True to Bakare’s observation, two of the three-tier 1 lenders,Zenith and Guarantee Trust, are among the 12 lenders fined a combinedtotal of over N499bn by the CBN for their inability to meet with theSeptember 2019 target of borrowing 60 percent of their deposits to thereal sector. The third lender – Access bank, survived thanks to thehuge loan portfolio it inherited from Tier 2 Diamond bank.Proshare is of the opinion that these lenders have looked to thesafety of the celebrity industry, to reduce the risk of borrowingfunds to the everyday farmer and small-time shoemaker. In a reportpublished Thursday, it listed a series of creative packages DepositMoney Banks are adapting to build quality assets in the creativespace.The most audacious plan is Access bank’s Creative Arts village in OgunState. Proshare notes that the village will help to ‘address issueslike the location for movie production, capacity building forpractitioners, and deepening the ecosystem of the Arts andEntertainment industry in Nigeria.’Herbert wigwe, the managing director of Access Bank, expects thevillage to create 2 to 3m jobs annually. The size of Access bank’sinvestment in Ogun State is indicative of the feeling in the industry.Cardinalstone notes that commercial lenders will likely be ‘antsy intheir strategies to grow loans.’ The research firm is also of the viewthat the new measures are also likely to force banks to anxiouslyre-evaluate their loan growth Strategy.One of such strategies is the United Bank of Africa (UBA’s) decisionto make Wizkid its ambassador.It had also hosted a discourse "Stars and Suits: Afropop meets HighFinance," that conference gave UBA the opportunity to build acollaboration between music stars and finance institutions.Zenith, ECO Bank, and GT are other banks that have and are buildingmore partnerships with clientele in the creative industry.These moves are no doubt, attempts by banks to keep their assetsrelatively strong, under the climate of a policy analysts expect toweaken them.
