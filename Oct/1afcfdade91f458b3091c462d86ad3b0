President Vladimir Putin hosts dozens of African leaders next week asRussia seeks to reassert its influence on the continent and beyond.The heads of some 35 African countries are expected for the firstAfrica-Russia Summit in the Black Sea resort of Sochi next Wednesdayand Thursday. For Putin, the summit is a chance to revive Soviet-era relationshipsand build new alliances, bolstering Moscow's global clout in the faceof confrontation with the West. "Russia has always been present in Africa, this is a very importantcontinent," Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said ahead of the summit."Russia has things to offer in terms of mutually beneficialcooperation to African countries." Though never a colonial power in Africa, Moscow was a crucial playeron the continent in the Soviet era, backing independence movements andtraining a generation of African leaders. Remnants of that influence remain, from the Kalashnikov rifle on theflag of Mozambique to the Angolan flag with itshammer-and-sickle-style gear and machete. The leaders of former Soviet client states like Angola and Ethiopiawill be at the forum, but so will others from where Moscow'sengagement has been traditionally low, like Nigeria and Ghana.
