The Nigerian High Commissioner to Malaysia, Nurudeen Muhammad, hasurged Malaysians not to judge the whole community of Nigerians basedon a small number of “bad eggs”.“If 1% of our population are criminals, that’s about 2 million peoplealready. I don’t think there are more than 2 million Nigerians who arecriminals across the world,” Nurudeen said during a celebration tomake Nigeria’s 59th independence anniversary."Malaysians should not think that the 'bad eggs' are representativesof Nigeria as a whole. “In every family, in every community, there isthe good and the bad,” he said.He was confident that Nigerian professionals have a lot to offer tothe world and not just Malaysia, saying that his home country is astrong trading market.UCSI associate professor, Patrick Nwabueze Okechukwu, said hisexperience after having been in Malaysia for more than a decade ispositive, though there were a few issues.“Racism can be seen anywhere,” he said. “It depends on differentsituations. There are times when you read and hear stories aboutwhat’s happening on the streets, you have to admit that racism doesexist.”However, he said Nigerians wanted to show that they had much to offerthe world in academia, trade, and information technology.One of the attendees at the celebration, Temitope Oladeji, urged theMalaysian government to be more stringent when vetting foreignstudents into the country.“Some of these ‘students’ don’t go to school and they want to do badthings,” said Oladeji.He recommended a better system, such as thorough background checks, toprevent law-breaking foreigners from entering the country.
