The Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, has stressed the need for improved security in the country. Aregbesola, who spoke when he received Nigeria Army Resource Centre led by its Director General, Major-General G.A. Wahab, in his office, said Nigeria’s economy would only improve when the security of everyone in the country can be guaranteed. In a statement made available to SaharaReporters, signed by Mohammed Manga, Director of Press and Public Relations, Aregbesola also demanded proper biometric capturing of Nigerian Citizens and Migrants with the view to ensuring effective internal security and socio-economic development in the country. “Without security in place, there can’t be any meaningful infrastructural development in any society, we need peace for development, recreation, and our general well-being is dependent on security," Aregbesola said, adding that civilization and infrastructural development can only take place when there is adequate security.
