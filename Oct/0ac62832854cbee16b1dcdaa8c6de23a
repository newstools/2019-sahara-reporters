Nigeria's leadership failure is a cause of its underdevelopment, saysDr. Tayo Haastrup, the chairman of the Nigerian Institute of PublicRelations, FCT Chapter.Hasstrup said this in Abuja on Tuesday during a news conference.Haastrup said, “Part of the dilemmas is the lack of good successionplan for young people. This has become a clog in our quest forvisionary leadership with the requisite drive to deploy our resourcesfor the good of the populace.“Hence, we today have a country with one of the best human resources,yet not living up to global expectations in all ramifications.“It is on these grounds that the 2019 AGM of the NIPR FCT chapter withthe theme, 'The Leadership Question: Search for 21 Century Leaders',is considered apt given the apparent leadership problem that hasbecome a monster not only in Nigeria but the whole of Africa.“It is therefore, important to kick-start the process of nationalrebirth through provision of platform such as this to enable allstakeholders generate insight in the area of the type leadershipNigerians must look out for if we are to have hope of resolving ourunresolved national issues.“These unresolved issues are poverty, rapid urbanization, regionalintegration, gender inequality, food, insecurity, violent conflicts,and political fragmentation etc."
