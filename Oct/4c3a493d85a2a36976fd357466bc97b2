 An Ikorodu Magistrates’ Court in Lagos has arraigned a 64-year-old man, Bassey Archibong, for having carnal knowledge of his four daughters aged between 12 and 20. The suspect had been having incestuous sexual relationship with the girls since 2016. Archibong was arraigned on three counts of sexual relationship with his daughters, failure to get their consent and involvement in an amoral relationship with the victims before the Ikorodu Magistrates’ Court 1, Lagos. The defendant however, pleaded not guilty to the charges, according to the News Agency of Nigeria. Prosecutor, John Iberedem, claimed that Archibong uses food as bait to get the girls to consent to his amorous desire. According to him, whenever the children objected, the 64-year-old would refer to Lot in the Bible, who had sex with his daughters and was not punished by God. He said, “The defendant beat the children and starved them whenever they confronted him on why he was sleeping with them. “He would tell them that intercourse between fathers and daughters were normal and approved by God. “He told the children that God did not punish Lot, who had sexual intercourse with his children, meaning that He approves of the act.” The Chief Magistrate, Mrs F. A. Azeez, remanded the accused person in a correctional facility pending advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions. She later adjourned the case until October 30, 2019 for further hearing.
