Details have emerged of how Abba Bichi, son of the Director General ofthe Department of State Services, Yusuf Bichi, was smuggled into theGolden Eaglets squad at the ongoing Brazil 2019 U-17 World Cup squad.SaharaReporters' investigations showed that the Golden Eaglet’s coach,Manu Garba, was coerced into selecting DSS boss' son even though thelad was said not to be good enough for the team.Some highly ranked officials of the Nigeria Football Federation hadcalled Garba while he was in Brazil preparing for the tournament withhis team. He was asked to drop one of the players for Bichi’s son.He initially rejected the directive but later succumbed to pressureamidst threats.A source in the Golden Eaglets camp in Brazil confirmed toSaharaReporters that Garba dropped Ogaga Oduko to include the15-year-old Bichi in the list submitted to FIFA.“Oduko had been with the team since the time of the U-17 Africa Cup ofNations tournament in Tanzania. He was also with the team during thepreparatory tour of Turkey and we all see his overall contribution tothe team.“We were surprised when he was dropped in the final squad list and sawthe name of Abba Bichi included,” sources told SaharaReporters.Bichi said to be based in China “was never part of the team"."We do not know much about him until his shock inclusion in the team,"SaharaReporters was told."He was not part of the squad when the team played the tournament in Tanzania."A source further disclosed: “What made his inclusion strange was thatwe were all in Brazil when he came into camp to join the team. He wasintroduced as the new player and Oduko was told that he would not bepartaking in the competition.“Oduko was told to stay in Brazil instead of going back to Nigeria andthe young lad was helpless."The DSS boss' son was an unused substitute in Nigeria’s first twomatches played by the Golden Eaglets in the tournament against Hungaryand Ecuador, which Nigeria won.Another reliable source familiar with the issue disclosed that thecoach did not confidence in the DSS boss' son's ability, as he had notseen him in action before he joined the team in Brazil.The source said, “Bichi, the DSS DG’s son might not play for the teambecause the coaching crew cannot vouch for his ability. You can seethat he was not featured in the game even though he was listed in thesquad.”“We may not get to see him play a crucial part in the tournamentexcept in games that the team does not place importance on.”According to FIFA U-17 World Cup Brazil 2019 regulations, the finallist of 21 players must be selected from the provisional squad list of50 players.The guideline also stated that any addition or changes that must bemade to the team list must be within the provisional squad submittedby the coach.Bichi’s name is conspicuously missing from the provisional squad, ashe was never part of the team prior to his inclusion.“Each participating member association shall submit a provisional listonline of a minimum of 22 players and a maximum of 50 players (aminimum of four of whom shall be goalkeepers) to FIFA, accompanied bya copy of the passport of each player appearing on the list.
