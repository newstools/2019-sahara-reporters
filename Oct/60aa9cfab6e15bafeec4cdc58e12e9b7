The Independent National Electoral Commission says it has saved overN290 million for combining the Kogi West Senatorial District and thegovernorship elections to hold on November 16.The INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, stated this at thecommissionâ€™s quarterly consultative meeting with political parties inAbuja, on Tuesday.According to Yakubu, the senatorial election would now cost less thanN10 million instead of the N300 million, if conducted as a standaloneelection.He explained: "In the case of Kogi West, it is a whole senatorialdistrict that the election petitions tribunal and the Court of Appealhad nullified the election conducted on February 23 and ordered INECto conduct a rerun."By coincidence, the judgment of the appeal court came very close tothe governorship election. So the commission decided to combine theelection with that of Kogi West Senatorial district."As a standalone election, the senatorial district election in sevenlocal government areas of the state would have cost the nation overN300 million."We have to get ad hoc staff, make arrangements for transportation,accreditation of observers and also the cost on the part of thepolitical parties and others."The INEC chair added, "But because we are combining the election withthat of the governorship, it is going to cost the nation less than N10million, instead of over N300 million."So, the commission decided to combine the two elections in order tosave cost and for convenience."Yakubu also pointed out that the Brass I state constituency election,holding in six polling units in Bayelsa, would also be conducted onthe same day with the governorship election.He said INEC already made arrangements for the elections.Yakubu appealed to political parties to advise their candidates andsupporters to shun hate speech, inciting statements, violent attackson opponents, destruction of electoral materials and other violationsof the Electoral Act.
