The United States of America's Department of the Treasury’s Office ofForeign Assets Control (OFAC) has sanctioned members of a significantcorruption network in South Africa that leveraged overpayments ongovernment contracts, bribery, and other corrupt acts to fundpolitical contributions and influence government actions.Specifically, OFAC designated Ajay Gupta, Atul Gupta, Rajesh Gupta,and Salim Essa for their involvement in corruption in South Africapursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13818, which builds upon andimplements the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act.“The Gupta family leveraged its political connections to engage inwidespread corruption and bribery, capture government contracts, andmisappropriate state assets.  Treasury’s designation targets theGuptas’ pay-to-play political patronage, which was orchestrated at theexpense of the South African people,” said Sigal Mandelker, TreasuryUnder Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.“The Guptas and Essa have used their influence with prominentpoliticians and parties to line their pockets with ill-gotten gains.We will continue to exclude from the U.S. financial system those whoprofit from corruption.”The sanctions announcement, according to a statement made available toSaharaReporters by the US Department of State, demonstrates the U.S.government’s unwavering commitment to supporting the rule of law andaccountability in South Africa."We support the anti-corruption efforts of South Africa’s independentjudiciary, law enforcement agencies, and the ongoing judicialcommissions of inquiry.  Moreover, we commend the extraordinary workby South Africa’s civil society activists, investigative journalists,and whistleblowers, who have exposed the breadth and depth of theGupta family’s corruption.THE GUPTA FAMILYAjay, Atul, and Rajesh Gupta immigrated to South Africa in the 1990s,and due in large part to their generous donations to a political partyand their reportedly close relationship with former South AfricanPresident Jacob Zuma, their business interests expanded.  The familyhas been implicated in several corrupt schemes in South Africa,allegedly stealing hundreds of millions of dollars through illegaldeals with the South African government, obfuscated by a shadowynetwork of shell companies and associates linked to the family.Credible reports of these corruption schemes include the Gupta familyoffering members of the South African government money or elevatedpositions within the government, in return for their cooperation withGupta family business efforts.  Public reporting has revealed Guptafamily efforts to garner the cooperation of a potential Minister ofFinance by promising millions of dollars in return for theindividual’s assistance in removing key members of the South Africangovernment who were considered to be stumbling blocks to the Guptafamily’s enterprises.In another instance of an attempt to obtain the assistance of a memberof government through illicit means, Rajesh reportedly promised a cutof a large scale development project to a provincial minister inreturn for the minister’s assistance.  While making this offer, Rajeshreportedly referred to two other politically powerful individualspresent at the meeting as receiving large monthly payments, similar tothe one being offered the provincial minister, directly from Rajesh inreturn for their assistance with a mining project.  In addition, theGupta family was overpaid for government contracts and then used aportion of the proceeds of those overpayments to donate money to aSouth African political party.Further, the family paid money to a South African government officialin exchange for the appointment of other government officials friendlyto the Gupta family business interests.  As a part of their corruptbusiness enterprise, South African government officials and businessexecutives discussed ways to capture government contracts and thenmove the proceeds of those contracts through Gupta-owned businesses.AJAY GUPTA Ajay Gupta (Ajay) is being designated for being the leader of anentity that has engaged in, or whose members have engaged in,corruption, including

which thePresident found that the prevalence of human rights abuse andcorruption that have their source, in whole or in substantial part,outside the United States, had reached such scope and gravity that itthreatens the stability of international political and economicsystems.Human rights abuse and corruption undermine the values that form anessential foundation of stable, secure, and functioning societies;have devastating impacts on individuals; weaken democraticinstitutions; degrade the rule of law; perpetuate violent conflicts;facilitate the activities of dangerous persons; and undermine economicmarkets.  The United States seeks to impose tangible and significantconsequences on those who commit serious human rights abuse or engagein corruption, as well as to protect the financial system of theUnited States from abuse by these same persons.To date, the Department of the Treasury has designated 118 individualsand entities under E.O. 13818.  This figure is in addition to
