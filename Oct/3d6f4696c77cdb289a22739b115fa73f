Retirees of the Nigeria Police Force under the contributory pensionscheme in Cross River State have petitioned President Muhammadu Buharirejecting the programme.The aggrieved retirees on Monday protested against what they termed asunfair treatment by the government.Speaking on behalf of his colleagues, the chairman of the retirees,Christopher Effiong, claimed that the National Pension Commission andthe police high command “have bluntly refused to see to the welfare ofpolice retirees".Another issue raised in the petition is the “refusal of policymakerswho strictly adopted the exemption provisions for military and secretpolice but ignored to follow suit the implementation of the futurecommencement to exempt those who had been in service already under thedefined benefits scheme before the enactment of the Pension Reform Act2004 Law of the Federal Republic of Nigeria".The petition also expressed disappointment over the failure of thepolicymakers to domesticate the law to exempt the Nigeria PoliceForce, which is the leading agency in internal security in Nigeria".Effiong said: “The amount of money paid to retired police officers asa lump sum and monthly pension, portrays an act of a calculated andsilent homicide against police retirees who have spent their youthfulenergy to serve this country under hazardous conditions."A superintendent of police is paid N800 million as a lump sum after35 years, and N45,000 monthly as pension while an army major or a DSSequivalent collects N10 million as gratuity and a monthly pension ofabout N200,000.”“The reality in Nigeria is that the police suffer the highest deathtoll as the leading internal security agency in this country andshould not be treated with this level of neglect and disdain.“This treatment is already affecting the morale of some servingmembers, and scores of our retirees die every year, as they can notraise money to buy drugs or feed their families.”
