An Igbosere High Court, Lagos, on Wednesday admitted the alleged confessional statement of suspected kidnapper, Chukwudumeme Onwuamadike, aka Evans, as exhibit. Delivering a ruling, Justice Adedayo Akintoye held that the test of voluntariness of a statement cannot be determined by a procedural law relied upon by the defendant, but by the provisions of the evidence act which is the instant law that regulates the admissibility of a statement. She said the defendant admitted during trial-within-trial that while he was making his confessional statement, there were no chains on his legs and no knife was held over his head. Akintoye said, “Once the basic requirements in obtaining statements from an accused person has been followed and no injustice can be said to have been caused to the defendant, the rules of evidence requires that the statement will be relevant and admissible in law.
