Adamawa State Governor, Ahmadu Fintiri, has reacted to a YouTube video where Senator Elisha Abbo described him (Fintiri) as “a small man in a big office”. Fintiri, in a statement by his Director General, Media and Communications, Solomon Kumangar, said he was too preoccupied with serving the people of the state to attend to petty issues. The statement reads, “The attention of the governor of Adamawa State has been drawn to a video circulating on the social media in which Senator Ishaku Abbo attempted to cast aspersion on Governor Ahmadu Fintiri. “His Excellency views the senator’s action as unfortunate and takes exception to the insults, innuendoes and attacks on his person and office. “However, for now, the governor does not intend to join issues with the senator. “Rather, His Excellency is in the delicate phase of laying strong bricks for the security, growth, development and prosperity of the people and institutions of Adamawa State and would not want to be distracted.” Senator Abbo, who is currently being tried for assaulting a woman inside a sex toy shop in Abuja, had in the said video described Governor Fintiri as “a small man in a big office”. Findings by SaharaReporters revealed that the embattled senator's outburst may not be unconnected to the outcome of the nomination process of the Peoples Democratic Party where all his sponsored candidates were screened out.
