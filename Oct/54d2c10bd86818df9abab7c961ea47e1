Many Uzere indigenes of Isoko South local government area in Deltastate have fled their homes following a bloody crisis currentlyrocking the community over a N20-million oil largesse released to thecommunity by the Nigeria Petroleum Development Company, (NPDC),operators of the Oil Mining Lease, OML 28.The N20 million meant for skill acquisition for the youths in the areawas reportedly diverted by the community's President General, FelixEwenede, in connivance with some leaders in the community.The crisis, it was reliably gathered, started on Wednesday andcontinued until Sunday, with a combined team of over 200 securityoperatives drawn from the army, navy, and mobile police taking overthe entire community.At least, 10 persons were hospitalized following the crisis.Some indigenes, who fled the community, told SaharaReporters that SamOgri, Columbus and Henry Etuwede were behind the vicious attackswitnessed in the community.They accused the trio of funding and supplying some community youthswith guns and other dangerous weapons to attack those opposed to the"diversion and embezzlement" of the N20 million.An indigene, speaking on the condition of anonymity said, "Ogri, hasbeen a major financier of these armed boys unleashing terror on thecommunity. Can you imagine that on Thursday, these armed boys wereexchanging gunshots face to face with the army and mobile police inbroad daylight?"As we talk, army, navy and mobile police have taken over ourcommunity with these armed boys shooting day in, day out non-stop,destroying properties and looting homes in the night. Some of us sleptin the waters until dawn because the community is in water because ofthe flooding. Everybody has run to other neighbouring communitiesbecause of the crisis."An indigene Uzere and current President General of the Isoko apexunion, Isoko Development Union, Iduh Amadhe, told SaharaReporters fromhis hideout, linked the crisis to bad leadership, greed and hunger forillicit wealth in the community.Amadhe explained further: "The community's president general is themajor cause of the crisis because he wants to grab every kobo thatcomes into the community from multinational oil companies. You can'twithstand the shooting in that community by some armed youths chasingaway perceived enemies and engaging security agencies in a gun duel."The recent N20-million largesse from the NDPC for skill acquisitionfor the youths that he diverted is the cause of this crisis that hasrocked the entire community since Wednesday. Like some of us, we arestill calling for peace and a combined team of security operativeshave already moved into the community."It was gathered that Felix Ewenede, the community's president general,was arrested and detained at the state police headquarters, Asaba, forinterrogation.Reacting to the allegation of financing and supplying guns to someyouths, Ogri said, "I am a peaceful man and will never be involved inanything that will cause a crisis in my own community."Meanwhile, at a security meeting organized by the Isoko Southcommunity and attended by traditional rulers, community leaders,councillors, the president general of IDU, area commander, Ozoro areacommand and heads of security agencies in the local government,presided over by the council chairman, Itiako Ikpokpo, the crisis inUzere was condemnedÂ  in Uzere.As of the time of filing in this report, peace had yet to return tothe community and many indigenes who fled had yet to return to theirhomes.The state commissioner of police, Adeyinka Adeleke, did not respond totelephone calls to get his comment on the situation neither did herespond to text messages sent to him.
