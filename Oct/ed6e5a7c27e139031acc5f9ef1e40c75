But all the issues werewell deliberated on. I must commend the council boss, Chief Ikpokpo,Chief Etaluku, Archbishop of the Oleh Diocese, Aruakpo, Odiologbo ofOwhe kingdom and all those working round the clock to bring lastingpeace in our community."Confirming the parley, an Isoko South leader, Dennis Etaluku, memberof the newly inaugurated Delta State Advisory and Peace-buildingCouncil, who was also part of the meeting, said, "Yes, there was apeace meeting held at the instance of the former chief of defencestaff, Alexander Ogomudia. What we did was a step-by-step approach."We have been able to reconcile all the leaders of the Uzere communitywith the former chief of defence staff, Alexander Ogomudia. The Uzereleaders have now accepted Ogomudia as their father, leader, and boss.And Ogomudia has forgiven all of them. Though we have first reconciledthe leaders (with one another), our next move is to treat all theother issues and reconcile the entire community."Etaluku added, "We have discovered that all the boys brandingthemselves 'freedom fighters' in the community had at one time or theother worked with all the leaders. Today, they are with you; tomorrowthey are with the other person. We have scheduled a meeting with theboys. We have gone a long way into the issues and we will continue thepeace process."
