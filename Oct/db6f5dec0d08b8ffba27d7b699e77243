The police in Anambra on Monday said that it had arrested 74 persons for alleged criminal offences, including child trafficking, within the month, according to the News Agency of Nigeria. Spokesperson for the police in the state, Haruna Muhammed, urged parents to be proactive about the safety of their children and other persons under their care. Muhammed said that the advice became necessary considering the rate of crime in society and how people betray the trust reposed in them. He said the suspects included three women allegedly involved in child trafficking and some fake military men allegedly terrorising residents of the state. He stated, “We are able to rescue two children between the ages of two and four from the child traffickers through the combined efforts of joint security teams in the state.” Muhammed disclosed that the suspects were arrested through intelligence report and attributed the success of the command to the launch of Operation Mkpochapu (Clean up) in the state.
