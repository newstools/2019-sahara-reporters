A Nigerian lawyer, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, says the Department of StateServices (DSS) to further detain pro-democracy activist Omoyele Soworeafter he is again granted bail tomorrow.The bail application of Sowore would be heard tomorrow (Friday) asscheduled after he was arraigned on Tuesday, at a federal high courtin Abuja.Sowore was earlier granted bail by the same court following theexpiration of the 45 days detention request granted the DSS by thecourt.Ejiofor, who had had to interface with the DSS while the IPOB leaderwas held in detention, said he would not be surprised if the DSS againflout a court order for the release of Sowore.“This country, we cannot predict. You know my client (Kanu) has hadthis hurdle, where the court would make an order that would be floutedwith reckless abandon. So, it is no longer strange to us.“Somebody has been granted bail by a court of competent jurisdiction,under normal circumstances, if he has perfected the condition of thebail, he should be allowed to go then charge him to court, he willcome to court to answer the charge.“They have no reason to refuse the court order, that would becontemptuous. They can decide not to release him. We have had caseswhere people are granted bail and they did not obey the court order."Continuing, he stated, "Anything can happen in a country where thereis no rule of law. We understand we are in a country with no respectfor the rule of law. They do whatever they feel; whether to obey ornot to obey."Sowore has been in DSS' detention facility since August  3 when he wasarrested in Lagos for being an organizer of the #RevolutionNowprotests.Sixty-one days after his arrest, he was charged with treasonablefelony, cyberstalking and money laundering.
