Five thousand civil servants in Adamawa state have taken to the streets in Yola to demand payment of their six-month salary arrears. Leader of the group, Faisal Baba, who presented a letter of protest to Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri, said three civil servants had died due to financial constraints caused by the state's indebtedness. The workers, holding placards with inscriptions like, "Pay us our six months salaries", accused Fintiri of stopping their salaries in the last six months. Crowther Seth, the state's deputy governor, who received the protest letter at the Government House stated, "Your issue will be looked into, when His Excellency comes back."
