IMF Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says the current economic growthin Nigeria is too slow to address the scale of poverty in the country.Kristalina Georgieva, the Managing Director of the InternationalMonetary Fund, said this at the World Bank/IMF annual meetings holdingin Washington DC, United States.The IMF boss said to address this, the Nigerian government mustdiversify the economy from whole dependence on crude.Georgieva reasoned that the growth of Nigeria is pivotal to thedevelopment of Africa hence its constant call for improved fiscalpolicies in the country.She said, “Nigeria matters to the whole of Africa. When Nigeria doeswell, Africa does well. What we see, however, is that economicrecovery remains still too slow to reduce vulnerabilities and mostimportant to reduce poverty in the country.“What we experience is some good thought around shaking up economicpolicy now that a government is being constituted in Nigeria.“We have been quite consistent to talk about three issues in Nigeria.One is the question of fiscal capacity. As you know, the taxcollection levels in Nigeria leave quite a lot of room for improvementand without strengthening the fiscal position of the government, theexpenditure side, of course, would suffer.”IMF also called for improved tax systems so that the government cangenerate revenue internally to funds programmes.In the area of economic diversification, Georgieva said, “We have beenconsistently recommending the country to diversify the economy becausereliance on oil does not serve very well and that means to continuewith structural reforms that would make that possible.”On the fight against corruption, she said there was a need for astrong anti-corruption policy that would be unambiguous.She said, “Fight corruption and make sure that the richness of Nigeriaserves Nigerians inside the country and in that regard, the Fund lastyear adopted a very clear, strong policy on anti-corruption.“We engaged with governments to build their capacity to make servingthe citizens of the country with the money of the country possible.”
