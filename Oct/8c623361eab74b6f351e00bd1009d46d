The Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), says the continued detention of pro-democracy advocate and convener of the #RevolutionNow protests, Omoyele Sowore, despite a court ordering his release, is a threat to freedom.Speaking on Nigeria's 59th independence anniversary and continued detention of the Sowore, MOSOP President, Fegalo Nsuke, asserted that the lack of respect for court orders by the Muhammadu Buhari-led APC government was a clear sign that the Nigerian government has little or no respect for its institutions and citizens' rights.While taking a swipe at the Buhari regime over flagrant disobedience to court orders, the MOSOP leader said: "Sowore now personifies the desire of Nigerians for true freedom and his ordeal is a call on Nigerians to rise to protect their rights and dignity."Buhari's government hasn't lived up to our expectations in terms of protecting the rights of Nigerians and in treating citizens equally. Citizen's welfare should be a priority but we haven't seen much in that direction."On security, job creation and protection of the environment, Nsuke berated and scored the Buhari's administration zero."The government hasn't given much attention to the environment. For instance, in Ogoni, despite the fraud in HYPREP, the government has remained silent allowing massive looting of Ogoni clean up funds. Howcan a government claim it's remedying the devastation of Ogoniland and will do nothing about compensation for families over livelihood loses. "No move to provide alternative sources of water and no plans on how to handle the contaminated soils. Buhari's government has performed very poorly in job creation, security and building national cohesion. These has worsened the security situation and gets young people into crime as the country is failing to give them hope."
