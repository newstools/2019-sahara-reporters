Aliko Dangote Dangote Refinery says it will not use pipelines to convey petroleumproducts from its refinery to consumers.Executive Director of Dangote Group, Devakumar Edwin, said the companywould use shuttle boats and expanded road networks to move products todifferent parts of the country.According to Reuters, Edwin said fuels would go via “shuttle” vesselsto Warri and Calabar, while other deliveries would go in trucks.He stated this while speaking at the Offshore Trading Logistics Expoin Lagos on Tuesday, disclosing that the company is fixing andexpanding one of the current roads to Lekki, while the Lagos Stategovernment will build another toll road to aid shipments.“That’s going to reduce a lot of congestion,” Edwin said.He noted that the refinery would eliminate fuel imports from other regions."Those who are importing today... can buy from our refinery,” he added.“We can export the product all over the world. So there is no need forus to (blindly) compete with the local production.”Beyond producing fuel from fossils, the company is also planning toextract ethanol from a sugar and molasses plant in Adamawa. It hasalso integrated blending plants as well.Current requirements demand that fuel be mixed with 10 percent ethanoland diesel be blended with 20 percent biodiesel.Nigeria’s production of fuel from both fossil and plant-based sourcesis too insufficient to meet consumption.
