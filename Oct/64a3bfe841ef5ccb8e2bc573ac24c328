A group, Citizens For Steven Kefas, has asked the Nigeria Judicial Council (NJC) to investigate the plight of Steven Kefas who has been in prison for 139 days for criticizing Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai. Kefas was said to have censured El-Rufai regarding the violence in Southern Kaduna communities, banditry and herdsmen’s killings, among others.The group is demanding his immediate and unconditional release, as well as reinforcement of his fundamental human rights.Speaking on behalf of the group on Monday during a press conference at the Nigerian Union of Journalists Press Centre in Abuja, Emmanuel Onwubiko challenged all people of good conscience to join in appealing to Justice Mairo Mohammed to grant Kefas bail.“We want Nigeria and the world to know that Kaduna State has become a centre of intimidation, harassment, and human rights violations.“We have come from different ethnic, religious and political backgrounds to draw the world’s attention to the grim situation of citizen Kefas.“As of Monday, October 7, 2019, he has spent 139 days in Kaduna Prison without bail for criticizing Governor El-Rufai,” he said.
