Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu, the presiding judge in the treasonable felonycase brought against the pro-democracy campaigner, Omoyele Sowore,will any moment from now give her ruling on the bail application ofthe activist.Sowore is standing trial alongside Olawale Bakare (Mandate) who wascharged for the same offence.Ojukwu stood down the matter to 1:30 pm for ruling after listening tothe arguments of the counsels.At the resumed hearing of the bail application on Friday at thefederal high court in Abuja, Falana told the court that defendantsshould be presumed innocent in line with section 36 of theconstitution.He submitted that the Supreme Court has never labelled the militarycoup d'etat as a revolution.He argued that the only option left for President Muhammadu Buhari wasto approach the court and sue the activist for libel.Falana asked the Department of State Services (DSS) to cite anysection of the law where protest is being criminalized.He said when Buhari lost an election in 2011 he called for revolutionthrough a protest in Kano.He added that the court of appeal held that the police permit hadoutlived its usefulness and that the protesters did not need a policepermit to stage a peaceful protest."It is the duty of the police to protect the protesters so thathoodlums do not take over the protests," he said.Falana urged the court to admit his clients to bail on liberal terms.The prosecution counsel, Hassan Liman, in his own argument asked thecourt to consider the severity of the offence committed by thedefendant.He, therefore, asked the court to dismiss the application.
