The radical statement of the prosecutor has been receivedby several anti-corruption groups across the world."At an international level, colonialism has been gradually replaced bythe corruption that has supported corrupt and dictatorial regimes,plundering the resources of countries for a few pennies at the expenseof the democratic, economic and social development of entirepopulations maintained at the level of poverty and forced to emigrateby hunger."Reacting to Greco’s statement, the Chairman of the Human andEnvironmental Development Agenda (HEDA Resource Centre), OlanrewajuSuraju, the Nigerian anti-corruption group pushing the prosecution ofthe suspects in the grand crime said the position of the prosecutorexposed the “ignoble chain of corruption and the global conspiracy oflocal and international officials whose shameful conducts continues tokeep Nigerians at the backbench of economic and industrialtransformation".According to him, the prosecutor has once again proven that criminalswill no longer have safe havens to warehouse their looted funds.Foreign anti-corruption experts currently in Nigeria, AntonioTricarico and Nick Hildyard, have praised the prosecutor for saying itas it is.The two are currently in Nigeria training selected community-basedorganizations, journalists and representatives of anti-corruptionagencies on strategies for tracing illicit funds and assets.Former President Olusegun Obasanjo had revoked the OPL 245, granted bylate dictator, Sanni Abacha to Dan Etete, former Nigerian Petroleum.Etete had reassigned it to Shell Nigeria Exploration and ProductionCompany which he later reclaimed through Etete’s Malabu Oil and Gas,in 2006 through the court.Shell rejected the decision, but the Government of former PresidentGoodluck Jonathan ensured Shell and Eni bought the OPL 245 in thepaltry sum of $1.1billion, ultimately diverted into private pockets.The EFCC investigation had held many Nigerian top shots for complicityin corruption and double-dealing in the implementation of thesettlement and resolution of agreements on OPL 245 between Malabu Oiland Gas Ltd, belonging to Etete and the federal government of Nigeriain 2010.EFCC's investigations indicated that over $1.2 billion was launderedin a series of criminal plots involving corruption and bribery all ofwhich are linked to Malabu, Shell Nigeria Ultra deep (SNUD) NigeriaAgip Exploration (NAE) and other Nigerian officials.The investigation and prosecution were launched in Italy, where Shell,ENI and some Nigerian officials and their foreign collaborators arefacing criminal charges.
