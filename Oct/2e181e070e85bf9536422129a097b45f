APC vs PDP cartoon  There is palpable tension in Yola, the Adamawa State capital, as the Governorship Election Petition Tribunal fixes Friday to give its verdict on, who is the authentic winner of the poll in the state. A statement by the tribunal said that the panel was set to deliver judgment on a petition filed by the All Progressives Congress challenging the election of Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of the Peoples Democratic Party. Chairman of the tribunal, Justice Adebara, had in August after the adoption of final addresses, promised to deliver a verdict. As a result of this situation, members of both parties in the state and their supporters have suddenly become apprehensive ahead of Fridayâ€™s ruling. Loyalists of both parties have been attacking each other on various social media platforms, creating tension in most parts of the state ahead of Friday. In the March 2019 contest, the Independent National Electoral Commission declared Fintiri winner after polling 376,552 votes to defeat the incumbent governor at the time, Bindo Jibrilla. However, Friday's ruling by the tribunal would determine if that victory remains intact or not.
