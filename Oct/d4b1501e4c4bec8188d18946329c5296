Residents of Haworth, Bergen County in New Jersey, where Nigeria's democracy activist, Omoyele Sowore resides, will be holding a protest today to press for his release and safe return of Sowore to his home in Haworth. The community is getting vocal about bringing him home safely, expressing great concern about his safety in the detention of the Department of State Services. According to NorthJersey.com, Sowore's family and borough residents will gather at Haworth Borough Hall on Monday (today) at 6 pm to bring attention to his situation in the hopes of getting him back to New Jersey. The group, which described the activist's as “unfair” noted that Sowore dedicated his life to demand better governance and ensure Nigerians enjoy the dividends of democracy. “Sowore has dedicated his life striving for a Nigeria that works for all of its citizens regardless of socio-economic background, religion or ethnicity,” the Haworth demonstration organizers said in a statement. “He has been unfairly detained and will go on trial for treason in early November for organizing a peaceful protest to end corruption, advocate for economic equality and guarantee education to all Nigerians." “We want the federal government paying attention,” said Haworth Councilwoman Heather Wasser, who is helping organize the event. “We want the United Nations paying attention. We want him out of Nigeria safely. Sowore is a green card holder, Wasser said. Congressman Josh Gottheimer, who represents the district that Sowore lives, said he is looking into the matter. “We’re in touch with the State Department on this matter and we’re speaking with the family regularly,” Gottheimer said in a statement.
