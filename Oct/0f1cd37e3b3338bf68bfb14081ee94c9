Few hours into the midnight deadline for industrial action over the minimum wage agreement between labour and the President Muhammadu Buhari regime, no agreement has yet been reached. Labour had said it would go on strike on October 17 (Thursday) if the government failed to reach an agreement with it yesterday (Wednesday) over the consequential adjustments of the minimum wage. News Agency of Nigeria reports that the meeting which began by 5 pm had yet to reach any agreement following a breakout session by both government and labour teams. As of the time of filing this report, both groups were still in breakout sessions. The organised labour is demanding 29 percent salary increase for officers on salary level 07 to 14 and 24 percent adjustment for officers on salary grade level 15 to 17 . The Buhari regime, however, presented a proposal of 11 percent salary increase for officers on grade level 07 to14 and 6.5 percent adjustment for workers of grade level 15 to 17
