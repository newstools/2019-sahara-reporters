nigeriafilms.com The Assistant Inspector-General of Police (AIG), Zone 2, Lagos, LawalShehu, says Nigerian policemen are sometimes induced to collectbribes, adding that both the bribe giver and taker are guilty ofcontravening the law.Shehu also reiterated that bail was free.The AIG, who spoke at a training for police officers on human rightsorganised by the Crime Victims Foundation of Nigeria (CRIVIFON),however, stated that there were times police officers might not wantto collect bribe but some desperate persons will still seek to offerit.He said: “Collection of bail money is corruption. It is not only thequestion of human rights. It is a corrupt practice because that meansthe officer is extorting money from some innocent persons. If somebodyis arrested, he or she should be investigated and given whateverpunishment they deserve. If you go to many of our police stations, itis boldly written."But don’t forget, when it comes to corruption, both the giver andtaker are offenders. Sometimes, the police may not want to be corruptbut they may be induced. That is why policemen also arrest forattempting to give bribes. It is an offence. But when someone is madeto pay under duress, it is corruption and a report should be lodgedagainst the officer.”The founder of CRIVIFON, Gloria Egbuji, noted that there were lots ofabuses like a violation of human rights by police officers.“By research, we have realized that they are ignorant.“We have discovered through research that these people are notknowledgeable about people’s rights so rather than stand by the sideand criticize we felt it was good to educate them. We realized thatsome of them have never attended any course since they came out ofpolice college.”
