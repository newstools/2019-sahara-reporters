Attahiru Jega, INEC Chairman Prof. Attahiru Jega, a former chairman of the Independent NationalElectoral Commission, has called for more action to prevent thebreakup of Nigeria before the 2023 elections.Jega said this while speaking at the Tell Magazine’s 20 years ofdemocracy conference on Wednesday.Jega noted that the people have lost trust in the electioneeringprocess and it might be fuel for the disintegration of Nigeria,TheCable reports.He said: “The CIA thought that 2015 was the do-or-die period forNigeria, that there would not be a Nigeria in the way you know afterthe 2015 general election – that has come to pass. But I think if wedo not take care, a lot of these predictions will come to pass that iswhy we need to do quite a lot, much more than we have ever done inorder to protect the integrity of the electoral process before 2023.“The clearest evidence of this loss of trust and confidence isdeclining voter turnout in elections since 1999.“For example, people have argued that in 2015 the generalizedinsecurity was a result of the activities of Boko Haram have beenresponsible for the low voter turnout regardless of the improvement inthe electoral process.”Jega, questioning the postponement of the 2015 and 2019 elections wonby the All Progressives Congress, said there was very low voters’turnout in the 2015 and 2019 elections attributing it to the lack oftrust in politicians.
