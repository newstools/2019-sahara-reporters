A group, Igbo Renaissance Forum, has accused the Nigerian Government of “playing politics” with issues that affect the South-Eastern part of the country following the continued closure of the Enugu International Airport. According to the group, the failure of the government to commence repair works in the airport more than six weeks after its closure, shows that there was a hidden agenda against the people of the region. It said, “Abuja runway was fixed in less than six weeks while Enugu Airport, the only international airport in the South-East, has been shut for over six weeks without a single action on the ground. This is unacceptable.” The group called on the government to immediately commence action on the airport and ensure its completion before the end of the year in order to ease the movement of travellers in December.
