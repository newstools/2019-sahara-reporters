Nigeria's anti-corruption agency, the Economic and Financial CrimesCommission, has presented its 14th witness to testify against a formerHead of Service, Stephen Oronsanye, in an ongoing alleged N2 billioncontract fraud lawsuit.Orosanye is standing trial alongside Osarenkhoe Afe, managingdirector, Fredrick Hamilton Global Services Limited, and his company,on a 49-count charge bordering on several contract award scams duringOronsanye’s tenure.The EFCC had a Union Bank branch manager, Adesegun Timothy, testifyagainst Oronsaye.Meanwhile, there was a mild drama when the presiding judge, JusticeInyang Ekwo, asked the EFCC to “put its house in order” in prosecutingthe case.Ade Okeaya-Inneh, one of the defendants’ counsel, had told the courtthat all documents tendered as exhibits had to be numbered properly.“There are some documents the prosecution was supposed to tender whichwere not properly numbered.“Procedurally, they have to number those documents in order to assistthe court and it also helps us.”They had served us some documents before and they served another settoday, they were supposed to have served them together so that we canfollow during examination-in-chief so it will be untidy for the courtto go on,” Okeaya-Inneh said.Responding, the prosecution counsel, Oluwaleke Atolagbe, said, “Thecourt ordinarily always insists that all the documents to be tenderedas exhibits should be numbered from beginning to the end as a bundle.”We have a document that is about 496 pages, part of the document wasserved on them before yesterday and the remaining part was served onthem yesterday.“So the complaint of the second defendant’s counsel was that thepagination on the document is different from what is before thecourt.”He, however, said the prosecution would heed the court’s advice in theinterest of justice.Justice Ekwo adjourned the matter until December 2, 3 and 4 for theprosecution to call its three remaining witnesses.
