Nigeria’s vice president Yemi Osinbajo
The Guardian Nigeria Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has challenged states in Nigeria toexplore ways of increasing their internal revenue generation andboosting their agricultural production.Osinbajo urged states to do more to harness the entrepreneurial spiritof Nigerians.The vice president stated this while delivering the keynote address atthe 18th Meeting of the Joint Planning Board (JPB) and NationalCouncil on Development Planning (NCDP), in Asaba, Delta State capital.He said, “states must engage in careful and well-thought-out strategicplanning in order to articulate and implement priorities derived fromstrategic thinking based on comparative advantages.”According to Osinbajo, the event themed, 'State Fiscal Sustainabilityand Economic Diversification in Nigeria', reflected the commoncommitment of the federal and state governments to work together inplanning the economic future of Nigeria and its people.“Our ultimate purpose is to create jobs and growth and as key economicmanagers in the context of Nigeria’s fiscal federalism, it isessential that we work collaboratively and in tandem.  I am optimisticthat the deliberations of this council will contribute to achievingthese noble objectives, which will lead us closer to lifting the 100million people that the president has promised that we will lift outof poverty in the next 10 years,” he said.He added, “I propose three things for the consideration of this augustbody as a means of increasing production and generating the revenuesat the state level. First, I would urge that states engage in carefuland well- thought out strategic planning in order to articulate andimplement priorities derived from strategic thinking and based oncomparative advantages.“Second, there is great scope for boosting agricultural production ifStates choose two to three high-value crops/products to specialize in.Such specialization will enable economies of scale in the provision ofsupport across the entire value chain of prepared land, seeds,fertilizers, and pesticides, storage, processing and transportation,marketing and sales. This also implies organizing the agro-alliedvalue chain from farm to table.“In a similar vein, states must take advantage of the entrepreneurialspirit of Nigerians by empowering economic clusters and trade groupsthrough the provision of basic infrastructure and shared facilities.”Osinbajo noted that the current move of the federal government toprovide broadband connectivity for all by 2023 "will assist the statesproductive base but they cannot charge fees for laying of broadbandinfrastructure, which is like strangling the goose that will lay thegolden eggs".However, he stated, "The complaint of many small businesses is themultiplicity of levies and charges by state and local governmentagencies. States should, in fact, invest in agencies that can helpsmall businesses comply with regulations and standards and accesscredit. When the businesses grow and employ more they create taxableprofit and taxable employees."The vice president, therefore, counselled state governors: "The keything is to think out of the box and utilize the opportunities thatare open to the state. Some would have advantages that can be readilyused in the area of tourism, others would be contiguous to majoreconomic centres like Lagos and Abuja which offer markets as well ascheaper and more affordable land for residential and industrialpurposes."Improving tax morale is also a very big part of the story as theevidence shows that people do not feel obliged to pay taxes and theyjustify this belief by asserting that they do not receive commensurateservices."It would also be necessary for States to improve tax administrationand widen the tax net by making it easier for people to pay tax bothin terms of easier processes and lower levels of taxation."
