Former governor of Bayelsa State, Timipre Sylva Nigeria’s minister of state for petroleum resources, Timipre Sylva,said on Wednesday that the country had lost the opportunity to claimN18.91 trillion — $62 billion from international oil companies.The sum is the estimate of what the attorney general of thefederation, Abubakar Malami, believes the country should havereceived, from a review of the revenue sharing formula in theProduction Sharing Contracts signed with the firms in the 1990s.According to Reuters, Sylva disclosed this to newsmen after theFederal Executive Council meeting in Abuja.“Nobody can bring out that kind of money,” Sylva said. “I mean, wecan’t get $62 billion. We can maybe get something from them but not$62 billion. It’s an opportunity we have lost.”Five oil companies – Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Eni, and Total, haveso far been approached individually to make remittances on a backdatedattempt by the government to review the PSC.One of the five firms told Reuters they had received a bill of closeto $10 million.“We have to ensure that this bill is passed. With this bill now, therewill be some adjustments in the fiscal regime and we believe that thegovernment will get a lot from the oil companies, especially theirdeep shore exploration activities,” Sylva added.The companies had earlier told the news agency that they do not agreewith the government’s demands, they have since made representations incourt. Section 16 of the act provides for the contract terms to bereviewed once the dollar crosses $20, after 15 years and every fiveyears subsequently.On Tuesday, the Senate adopted a report by the joint committees onpetroleum upstream, gas and finance, seeking to amend the PSC.The details of the amendments made are sketchy at this time.According to a 2018 executive bill sent to the 8th assembly, theexecutive requested that section 16 of the act be amended with theintroduction of a third section that will make the government get morefrom royalties as oil prices increase.Royalty rates are fixed percentages at the moment, with petroleumsourced at depths deeper than 1000m paying 0 percent.Based on debates held during the passage of the PSC amendment onTuesday, the period of review after the initial 16 years, whichelapsed in 2008, was increased from five to eight years.The executive hoped to earn at list N320 billion with the passage ofthe bill in 2018 to fund the 2019 budget.President Muhammadu Buhari now hopes the country will make $500million – N152.5 billion in 2020 and $1 billion – N305 billion in 2121if the revision of the law sales through.
