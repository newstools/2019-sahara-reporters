Former President Goodluck Jonathan should apologize to Nigerians rather than try to defend himself against accusation by ex-British Prime Minister David Cameron that he did not allow the UK intelligence to rescue the more than 200 kidnapped Chibok girls when it was possible.That is the view of the Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC).The Islamic group said in a statement by its director, Prof. Ishaq Akintola, on Friday (today): “The best Jonathan can do now is to apologize to Nigerians for the Chibok debacle. Jonathan should just swallow his pride and eat the humble pie. There are no two ways to it. An unreserved apology is what Nigerians are expecting and we will keep pounding the ex-president until he does the needful.“We are concerned because that abduction emboldened the insurgents, exposed our underbelly and endangered Nigerian citizens to more criminalities. It was a huge blow to our security apparatus. Whatever threatens the safety and security of lives and properties of Nigerians must attract the interest of every serious civil society group. The Chibok incident opened the floodgate to the frequent kidnappings in the country today.”The group also appealed to President Buhari to double the government’s efforts to rescue the girls from captivity.“We strongly appeal to President Muhammadu Buhari to double government’s efforts aimed at securing the freedom of the Chibok girls. It is now five and a half years since these girls were taken away. We are in grief. Our nights are nightmarish. Horrible fears envelop our days. Please bring back our girls," MURIC said.MURIC urged Nigerians to intensify their prayers for both the Chibok girls and Leah Sharibu.It stated, “We urge Nigerians to intensify their prayers for the safe return of the Chibok girls. We must also remember Leah Sharibu, the lone Christian girl who was denied freedom by the insurgents.”
