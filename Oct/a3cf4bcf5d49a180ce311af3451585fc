The Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) has alleged that thePresident Muhammadu Buhari regime is mounting undue pressure on theChief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Tanko Muhammad, to accept a list ofsome persons allegedly selected to be members of the presidentialelection petition appeal tribunal.At a press conference held in Abuja on Thursday, the spokesman forCUPP, Ikenga Ugochinyere, said the coalition would reject any moves tohandpick justices to seat on Atiku Abubakar’s appeal.Atiku was the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) duringthe 2019 presidential election. He had approached the Supreme Court toappeal the judgment of the Court of Appeal which dismissed hispetition against the declaration of Buhari as the winner.Ugochinyere said, “We have it on good authority that the APC-ledfederal government has been mounting undue pressure on the ChiefJustice of Nigeria and indeed the entire court to accept a handpickedpanel and jettison the age-long tradition of the court of selectingthe most senior justices of the Supreme Court to sit on the panel.“The disquiet and bad blood caused by the APC in the Supreme Court nowis a clear desecration of the highest temple of justice in the land.The opposition and most Nigerians will not accept a handpicked panel,neither will the pronouncement of such panel command the requiterespect and confidence of the people of Nigeria and we in theopposition."He added, “The Supreme Court is supreme and its words must be for theprotection of the society and the people and the law. A grave errorwas done at Appeal Court and the nation is waiting to see how a manwho violated the Electoral Act and was supposed to have beendisqualified managed to survive at the Appeal Court. That court failedin both the issues of law and issues of national interest.”
