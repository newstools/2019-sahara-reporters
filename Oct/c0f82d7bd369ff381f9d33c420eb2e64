Fayemi stated, “The forum as the representative body of the stateskeenly followed what happened in the negotiations that led to thattemplate.“As far as we are concerned, the best the forum can do is to stickwith what has been agreed with the states. States are part of thetripartite negotiations.“The FEC does not determine what happens in the states. Each state hasan executive council which is the highest decision-making organ in thestate.“As far as we are concerned, the states were part of the tripartitediscussion and agreed to the N30,000 minimum wage.“States also know there will be consequential adjustments, but thatwill be determined by what happens on the state by state basis becausethere are different numbers of workers at states. There are differentissues at the state level. Every state has its own trade unions andjoint negotiations committee and they will undertake discussions withtheir state governments.”The governor said there was a difference between the national minimumwage increase and the general wage review.Fayemi said, “This is about minimum wage increment; yes that maynecessitate consequential increment, there is no doubt about it, butthat is a matter between the states and their workers.“The day after this agreement was reached with labour, it was onrecord that I was on national television and made the position of thegovernors clear. That for us this was a national minimum wageincrease, not a general minimum wage review. Yes, that may necessitateconsequential increment, we have no doubt about that but that it is amatter for the states to discuss with their workers."However, reacting to the position of the Forum, the labour unions,berated the governors.Ugboaja, in an interview with Punch, said no state could discard thefact that a minimum wage of N30,000 would be at the centre of everynegotiation.“Everybody will negotiate differently based on the state economy butwhat is sacrosanct is the minimum wage of N30,000 and how that will beadjusted across the board is the function of collective bargainingbetween the workforce and government,” he said.On its part, the Trade Union Congress said there was an assurance fromthe Nigerian government that the official template for the adjustmentswould be released to labour this week.The Secretary-General of the union, Origi Musa-Lawal, however, cautioned Fayemi.He said, “The state governments are only playing games. They wererepresented in the minimum wage committee. They cannot come around todeny their responsibility. They are simply courting labour anger andwe are ready for them.“Guidelines have not been released by the federal government butcertainly, we have assurances that the template will soon bereleased.”The union and the federal government had on October 18, 2019, reachedan agreement on the consequential adjustments in workers’ salariesarising from the new wage structure after about six months ofnegotiation.Both parties agreed on 23.2 percentage increase for workers at gradelevel 07; 20 percent for those at grade level 08; 19 percent forworkers at grade level 09; 16 percent for those at levels 10 to 14;and 14 percent for workers at grade levels 15 to 17.
