For six years, Abdulrasheed Maina has been evading the laws before hiseventual arrest on Tuesday.Maina had been milking funds meant for Nigerian pensioners through hisposition as chairman of the Pension Reform Task Team (PRTT) before hisdismissal in 2013 following a fraud of N2 billion.In 2015, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, pressedcharges of corruption on him and his accomplices. He fled the countrybefore the trial could commence prompting the issuance of an arrestwarrant against him, and his listing on INTERPOL’s Red Notice.Though Maina’s name was placed on the INTERPOL’s wanted list itsuddenly disappeared from the International police platform and Mainafreely globe-trotted, including meeting with the current AttorneyGeneral of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, in Dubai.In September 2017, Maina was secretly reappointed into the NigeriaCivil Service as he was issued a letter recalling him to the civilservice and posted as acting director of Human Resources at theMinistry of Interior.This drew a lot a public outcry and criticism forcing the president toeventually dismiss him from his administration.It was discovered that Malami was behind Maina’s reinstatement as hegave positive legal advice and recommended that he should bereabsorbed into the civil service.This was after Malami met with Maina in Dubai, a move that was backedby the former Director General of the State Security Services, LawalDaura.Malami further confirmed his role in protecting Maina from the longarms of the law in January 2018 when he spoke on The Interview, amagazine programme.Malami said: “At the time the meeting was held with Maina, Mr.President was not aware. But much later, after we returned back home,I took Mr. President into confidence about the information and soughtleave to share it with other agencies with the purpose of blockingleakages.“That was the extent to which the President was aware of theinformation. He came to be aware of the meeting with Maina much later.It was out of the desire to seek for his directives relating to theinformation in terms of its application for the purpose of blockingleakages associated with the looting of pension funds.”In 2018, he also asked the court to order the senate to stop the probe of Maina.Daura, another individual that was supporting Maina, has been abettingtop criminals in the country to evade justice during his tenure as hehelped notorious 419 kingpin, Emmanuel Nwude evades arrest.Daura connived with the ex-Inspector General of Police, Tafa Balogun,and shielded Nwude from arrest before the special crack team of theEFCC was able to eventually arrest Nwude in the guesthouse of theformer Police IG.Similarly, Daura helped Maina become invisible as he went around withDSS operatives as a bodyguard.It was discovered that during the search for Maina in 2017, Daura madethe DSS and the Nigeria Police Force to provide protection for Maina.The DSS also provided an accommodation for him where he safely hidwith DSS personnel guarding the house.The change of guard in the DSS exposed Maina as he was eventuallyarrested on Monday by the DSS that once protected him from the law.Another top government official, Abdulrahman Dambazau, was identifiedto have helped Maina evaded arrest.Dambazau, former Minister of Interior, was part of the top individualsbehind Maina’s reinstatement into the civil service.The Senior Staff Committee of the Interior Ministry headed by Mr.Dambazau recommended and played a major role in ensuring that Mainawas reinstated.Corroborating the support Maina received from top government official,a source said that Maina was “a friend of the government, noenforcement agency would dare take him into custody.”Maina in January 2019 secured a court order stopping the EFCC fromdeclaring him wanted.Justice Giwa Ogunbanjo of the federal high court described the actionof the anti-graft agency in declaring Maina wanted as unlawful, butthe commission vowed to appeal against the order.
