Aremu Afolayan, an actor and filmmaker, has slammed at the critics whohave tagged him a gigolo.In an interview with Scoop Sunday, the actor, who is a brother toKunle Afolayan, a Nollywood producer, said if his critics got theexposure and opportunity, they had been a gigolo.He said being in a relationship with an older person does not mean hegets financial benefit from it.Afolayan said, “That is an old gist, and I really don’t want to talkabout it. But, even if I am doing that, it is nobody’s business. I amsure (the people talking, would) also want to do that (if they had theopportunity).“I am a businessman, and you can actually refer to me as a prostitutein business. I sell cars, clothes, wrist watches, and many otherthings. Dating someone older than one is different from someone olderpaying one’s bills. I don’t think there is anything wrong in dating ormarrying someone older than one.”He also debunked assumptions that Nollywood actresses engage inprostitution or sex for roles.On why actresses seemed to fare better than actors in the industry,Afolayan said, “Most people have a side business. Even many Hollywoodcelebrities have side businesses. One problem, though, is that somepeople live up to certain expectations that nobody is even asking themto in the first place."But ordinarily, both male and female actors should be making so muchmoney that they should be the one sponsoring politicians, and not theother way round.”
