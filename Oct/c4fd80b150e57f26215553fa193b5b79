File Photo A youngman, Othniel Anselm, who lost his sister and her friend after they were denied treatment at an Airforce Hospital located along Bauchi-Jos Expressway following a road accident, has cried out for justice. Anselm, who took to Twitter to express his grief on Thursday said, “My younger sister, Jemima, was involved in a road accident on her way to church one Sunday morning. “She was in her sophomore year at the University of Jos studying Statistics while her friend, Jennifer, who she commuted with, was in her final year. “What was supposed to be a harmless journey in a tricycle, turned out to be a tragedy when some drunk guy driving left his lane, climbed the road barricade, hit the 'keke' my sister and her friend was travelling in, and somersaulted three times.” Anselm reported that the drunk driver whose birthday was on Sunday, survived the accident, and confessed to being drunk after celebrating overnight. Meanwhile, the commercial transport operator died on the spot of the accident. Speaking further, Anselm added, “My sister and her friend were still alive after the car hit them and they were immediately rushed to the nearby 347 Nigerian Airforce Hospital on 303 Rayfield Road, NAF Station on Bauchi-Jos Expressway. “Unfortunately, the hospital rejected both of them as they demanded a police report before taking them in. “From there, they were rushed to another hospital but before any medical help could be given, Jemima and Jennifer died. “Worse still, the police are currently attempting to grant the murderer of three people bail. “My sister, her friend and the commercial transporter were casualties of the reckless driving of a drunk driver. “Jemima and Jennifer died as a result of a failed medical system and neglect at the hospital. “All I want is justice. I owe my sister that much.”
