The Nigeria Police Force has asked members of the public to come forward and report misconduct of its officers. The call was in response to an exclusive story by SaharaReporters on how police personnel were demanding at least N20,000 from victims of 'one chance' robbery operations in Abuja to launch investigation into such reported incidents. Force Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba, who spoke on behalf of the police, said the security agency forbids the receipt of money as a precondition for service. He said, “The Nigeria Police Code of Conduct forbids the demand or receipt of money as a precondition for the rendering of police services to the public. “Citizens are advised to report all allegations of police misconduct to appropriate police authorities."
