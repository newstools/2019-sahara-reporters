The average earning of staff working in the oil and gas industry inSub-Saharan Africa is equivalent to the lowest cadre of earning on theNorth American continent.This is the discovery made by Oil and Gas Job search and NES Global Talent.According to the ‘Oil and Gas Outlook Guide’ for 2019, which the pairpublished on Wednesday, the average annual take-home of an employee ofa petroleum firm in North America, is $97,000 – 34.94 million.This is double the $48,600 – N17.28 million average paid to workers inthe fossil fuel industry in Africa.This implies that the monthly take-home of staff in the oil and gassector in Nigeria is less than N1.5 million.“The average salary amongst workers in North America is $97,000 perannum almost double the $48,600 earned on average by oil and gasworkers in Sub-Saharan Africa,” the report said.Out of a little over 33,000 respondents, 48 percent of them command asalary of less than 50,000, findings from the survey showed.It also noted North America’s superiority in wage demand. About 13percent of them earn $150,000, as against 6.6 percent of the globalaverage on that bracket.Oil and Gas Job Search also observed that 45 percent of those who tooktheir survey, said they had received increased pay since the lastresearch in 2017.“45% of oil and gas workers have received salary increases in the past12 months, and based on the current market, more than three-quartersof bosses expect salaries to grow in the year ahead, up fromtwo-thirds in 2017.”The sample of 33,000 plus respondents in 171 countries, indicated thatlogistics and quality assurance, are the list paying job offerings inthe oil and gas industry.“Reservoir and Petroleum Engineering, Subsea / Pipelines andProduction Management are the most lucrative disciplines in the oiland gas industry - 29% of employees in these disciplines earn at list$100,000 per annum, and the average salary in each exceeds £70,000 perannum. That’s compared to just 17% of employees working in Logistics,and 18% of those working in Quality Assurance / Quality Control.”The survey noted as well that there were considerable skills shortagesin the industry, specifically in engineering and design. It observedthat the number of women who filled their questioner, increased byabout 150 percent, from 1,000 to 2,500.The survey also unearthed that men are 19 times more likely to receivean annual pay of N150,000 than women, wo are also over-represented inthe lower earnings bracket.Contrary to beliefs that the petroleum market could be over-suppliedin 2020 – leading to a further depression in prices, the researchpublishers say the industry is ‘in vibrant good health’.
