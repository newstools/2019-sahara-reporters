This was grip and panic walkingagain through the submerged communities of Oke-Ado and Oke Bola inIbadan on the 18 and 19 September 2019.Earlier this year, the Nigeria Meteorological Agency (NIMET) hadreeled out 12 states in the country that will experience extremeflooding with about 600 local government areas in the country statedto be under the threat of flood.Instructions were given to residents to avoid building structureswithin the flood plains, keep up with the exercise of cleaning theirdrainages and avoid undue disposal of waste.However, in the late hours of Wednesday 18 September, the residents ofOke-Ado and Oke Bola had quite a different narrative to the cause offlooding that bared on them.Residents of Oke-Ado and Oke Bola had had a break from flooding untilthe era of former governor of Oyo state, Adebayo Alao-Akala. Theformer governor had seen to the need to reconstruct tardy roads in thecommunities but had actually done so at a more grievous cost—roadswere expanded with little attention to the influx of water makingwaves from the far-off river of Odo Alagbafo to the drainages in localcommunities.The construction was done in such a way that linkages were water couldflow freely were blocked.Further compounding the problem were the emergence of filling stationsthat had barred the torrent flow of water with underground rings.Consequently, people are constantly compelled to saddle up theirgirdle when the storm arises.Residents, understanding that road constructions cannot be reversed,attributed the need for constant dredging of neighbouring canals,ditches and drainages to allow for easy water flow.The government in their own accord had failed to meet up with theobligation of sending appropriate authorities to do the needed. Theyare, therefore, left to bear the cross of clearing the guttersoccasionally.“There is a deep gutter that runs from Odo Alagbafo right through OkeBola and Oke-Ado. On a routinary basis, we pack out the sands in thesegutters by ourselves but whenever there is heavy rainfall, it goesstraight back in. This we do because the government has not beenconsistent in making sure that these gutters are dredged,” one of theresidents said.Another victim had added that the manual act incorporated by people tosave their skin has been well practiced for years but they indulge theservices of the right body to do proper justice to cleat blockeddrainages and culvert waterways also adding that residents had alsofailed to play their part in keeping flood at bay.He said, “There was usually a refuse site in the community but now itis no more in view. Newly sprouted buildings that came up afterwardresorted to putting their waste in nylons and throwing them anywherethey like such that when rain falls, it moves them all thereby causingblockages.”The recurrent issue of flooding is the communities have gone out ofhand to cripple residents off a good standard of living.While the issue may appear stale even with the minimality of rainfallever since September, residents are still yet to recover from theirhuge loss and are apprehensive of a repeat of the flood.“Whenever rain falls, all my properties such as my plasma tv, radio,shelves are ruined completely. I am not very buoyant to make adecision to leave my home, and considering the outrageous feesdemanded by agents, it is enough to keep us where we are. We can’tafford to sleep whenever these rains fall."We sleep in it and wake up the following day to continue to scoopwater from our homes. The government should come to our aid as we arestill trying to recover from the flooding issue in 2018—where it hadall started again,” a victim of the flood at Oke Bola said.Another affected victim in Oke-Ado who preferred to remain anonymousadded, “We were all affected by the flood. It has been two days sincethe rain fell, but I can’t open my shop because all my carpentry toolshave been destroyed by the rain. There has been poor maintenance onthe part of the government."The drainage cannot flow properly because of the wrong constructionof the road and the bridge that lies ahead. We fear that we maycontinue to have to live with this when it happens again.”
