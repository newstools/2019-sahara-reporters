An Akure-based legal practitioner, Kariakitei Kokowei, has dragged the President Muhammadu Buhari government to the court over its failure to appoint an indigene of Ondo State as the managing director (MD) of the NDDC. Kokowei, in an originating summons sighted by SaharaReporters, argued that the action of the government on the appointment of the MD of the NDDC was contrary to the rotational arrangement as entrenched in Section 12(1) of the NDDC (Establishment, Act 2000).He explained that an Ondo state indigene was entitled to be appointed as managing director or executive director of finance and administration or executive director of projects of the board.He asked the federal high court to make an order for the government to nominate any qualified and experienced person from the oil-producing areas of Ondo State to be confirmed by the senate.In a related development, Success Odogbo, a social critic has sued the Chairman of the Ondo State Oil-Producing Areas Development Commission (OSOPADEC) at the federal high court in Akure to compel the OSOPADEC to make available the certified true copies of the documents containing the budget details of 2017 and 2018.Odogbo is also demanding from the commission the status reports of projects as contained in the budgets of 2017 and 2018 indicating the project type, location, local government company/contractor, contract sum, and status/level of execution.The suit was brought pursuant to Order 34 Rule 1 (1) (a) and Rule 5(1) of the Federal High Court ( Civil Procedure) Rules 2019; Section 20 of the Freedom of Information Act 2011 and the inherent jurisdiction of the court.
