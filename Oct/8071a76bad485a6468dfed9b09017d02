Ahmad Lawan Senate President Ahmad Lawan is urging Nigerians to pray more for their country's security agencies in view of the challenges facing Nigeria. According to him, the power of God is beyond the weapons provided for the security forces. He stated this on Wednesday when a delegation of the Christian Legislators’ Fellowship of the National Assembly visited him. Lawan said: “The various challenges that Nigeria and its people face, we even need to pray more. “Today, we face serious security challenges. Where we have security agencies, which are mandated to ensure that we are secured and protected, if nothing, we should pray for them that they are able to perform well. “It is not only in empowering them with weapons; the power of God is beyond weapons. “I’m sure that all people of faith will continue to pray for our security agencies to protect us.”
