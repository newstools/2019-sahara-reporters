Hundreds of foreign nationals on Wednesday took to the streets of CapeTown, demanding to be relocated from South Africa after camping at theUN refugee agency offices for a week, Agence France Presse reports.The foreigners, many of whom described themselves as asylum-seekers,say they no longer feel safe in South Africa after a surge ofxenophobic attacks last month."Save lives of refugees before it is too late," said one slogan,painted in green on a white banner.Many of the protesters have been camping at the offices of the UnitedNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Cape Town sinceOctober 9, vowing not to leave the premises until the agency addressedtheir concerns.The numbers had grown steadily over the past week, spilling out fromcorridors to the kerb outside the building."We marched to parliament for the government to hear us and to send aloud and clear message," said Sylvia Nahimana, a group representativefrom Burundi."We have been negotiating with them since 2008 but the killing still goes on."Xenophobic violence left at least 62 dead that year. Seven people werekilled in 2015 and 12 died in the latest spate of attacks this year --most of them South African. The incidents occurred mainly in theJohannesburg area.The continent's most industrialized economy is a magnet for migrantssearching for better job prospects and asylum seekers looking forsafety.The country attracts people from neighbouring Lesotho, Mozambique and Zimbabwe.Others come from farther afield including the Democratic Republic ofCongo (DRC), Rwanda, Burundi, Nigeria, and South Asian countries.Seen as competing with locals for jobs, they are often the first tocome under fire when South Africa's chronic unemployment andinequality boils into resentment."We aren´t safe here and we aren´t safe in Bangladesh either," saidHafeez Mohamed, a political dissident who sought refuge in SouthAfrica's Northern Cape province, where he saw his grocery store burneddown."They treat us like chickens and we don´t want to be chickens here anymore."The protest broke out following a visit by the UNHCR chief."Preserving fair and efficient asylum systems are vital," said FilippoGrandi in a statement on Wednesday."But to function effectively, they must be accompanied by safe,regular migration channels and other stay arrangements."But Grandi noted that resettlement to third countries was a "verylimited option for refugees worldwide", as the number of resettlementplaces was dropping.South Africa is home to 268,000 refugees and asylum seekers, accordingto government statistics. They are mainly from Somalia, Ethiopia,Zimbabwe, and the DRC.But the exact number of foreign nationals is unknown as the majorityare undocumented."South Africa isn´t better than the home countries we fled," saidCongolese Jean-Pierre Balus at the scene."We want to go somewhere out children have a future, where we aren´tsegregated.""There is no future for us here," he added.
