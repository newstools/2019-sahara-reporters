Dr. Oby Ezekwesili A former Minister of Education, Oby Ezekwesili, has condemned the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari for building a fence around the Unity Fountain. The popular and iconic fountain in the heart of Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, has served as a rallying point for many important events and demonstrations over the years without any restriction in access. Reacting to the development in a post on Twitter, Ezekwesili said the move by the government will end in tears. She said, “Let me offer free counsel to our @NGRPresident @MBuhari. Ask your contractors to pull down the fence and roll back their construction equipment @Our Unity Fountain now. “This act of stifling citizens’ voice will end in tears. But it won’t be citizens crying, sir! “This is childish. Why is the government afraid of civic right to assemble?”
