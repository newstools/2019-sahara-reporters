Governor of Lagos State, Akinwunmi Ambode Akinwunmi Ambode, immediate past governor of Lagos State has draggedthe Lagos State House of Assembly to court over a probe of theprocurement of 820 buses by his administration.Ambode urged the Lagos High Court in Ikeja to stop the probe, accusingthe state's lawmakers of deliberate misrepresentation of facts.Justice Y.A. Adesanya, therefore, summoned Mudashiru Obasa, LagosState House of Assembly's Speaker, to appear before it.A statement by Itesiwaju Eko Foundation stated that Ambode instituteda suit against the assembly to contest the constitutionality of theprobe, which were procured based on budgetary approval as part of thestate's bus reform project."In an order dated 29 October 2019 issued by Justice Y.A. Adesanyaafter hearing a motion ex-parte moved by Ambode’s lawyer, Tayo Oyetibo(SAN), other defendants ordered to appear before the court at 9 am onWednesday, October 30, are House Clerk, Mr. A.A. Sanni; Chairman ofthe Ad hoc Committee set up by the House to probe the procurement,Fatai Mojeed and members of the Committee. They are Gbolahan Yishawu,A.A Yusuff, Yinka Ogundimu, Mojisola Lasbat Meranda, M.L Makinde,Kehinde Joseph, T.A Adewale, and O.S Afinni.“Justice Adesanya ordered the originating processes and all theaccompanying processes filed by the claimant (Ambode) to be served onthe defendants and subsequently fixed Wednesday, October 30, 2019, fora hearing of a motion for an interlocutory injunction,” it said.The foundation added, “According to his statement of claim before thecourt, Ambode said contrary to deliberate misrepresentation of factsby the lawmakers, the procurement of the 820 buses was well capturedin the 2018 Appropriation Law which was duly approved by the House.“In Section 1 of the bill, the first defendant (House of Assembly)authorized the total budget for the year 2018 to be N1,046,121,181,680comprising N347,038,938,872 only and N699,082,242,808 only as therecurrent and capital expenditures, respectively.“Part of the items authorized by the bill under capital expenditurewas: 'LAGBUS Public Transport Infrastructure (MEPB); Part financing of820 buses' which was item 8 under schedule 1- Part C of the bill.“He added that having prescribed the manner of withdrawal of funds insections 3 and 4 of the 2018 Appropriation Law, it wasunconstitutional for the House to attach another condition in Section9 of the law for further approval to be sought before incurring anyexpenditure on the purchase of the buses.“Highlighting the specific breach of his constitutional rights to fairhearing by the house, the former governor said on August 27, 2019during proceedings of the Assembly, some lawmakers thoroughly vilifiedand disparaged him as having purchased the buses without budgetaryapproval and that the procurement was a waste of public funds, whileat the end of the proceedings, the house resolved to constitute an adhoc committee to probe the procurement."According to the statement, Ambode said it was surprising that thelawmakers who contributed actively in vilifying, disparaging anddenigrating him constituted the bulk of the members of that committee,which was a clear derogation of his right to a fair hearing.Ambode added that in continuation of deliberate misrepresentation offacts of the issue, the house falsely claimed that an invitation wasextended to him to appear before the committee but that he failed tohonour it.The Eko group's statement said further, “On Thursday 10 October, 2019,the fourth and fifth defendants (Mojeed and Yishawu) who are chairmanand member of the committee respectively set up by the first defendantpursuant to the provisions of Section 129 of the Constitution againraised on the floor of the House an allegation that the claimant(Ambode) was invited to appear before the committee but that he failedto do so; whereupon the second defendant (speaker) ruled that awarrant of arrest would be issued against the claimant if he refusesto appear before the committee.“The claimant states that no letter of invitation was delivered to himbefore the fourth and fifth defendants made the false allegationagainst the claimant which was widely reported by various nationalnewspapers in the country."Ambode averred, “Further to the foregoing paragraphs, the firstdefendant had also invited some of the former commissioners who servedunder my government to appear before the first defendant on Tuesday 15October 2019. These included former commissioners for energy,agriculture, and economic planning and budget, respectively amongstothers.“After the proceedings of the committee on 15 October 2019, the firstdefendant represented to the public that the former commissioners thatappeared before it had indicted me in their testimonies. Theinformation was widely published by national newspapers on Wednesday16 October 2019.“Contrary to the information made to the public by the firstdefendant, the said former commissioners for energy and economicplanning and budget who were represented by the first defendant tohave indicted me, made public statements on Thursday 17 October 2019denying that they ever indicted me in their testimonies before thecommittee. The denials were widely published by online newspapers onThursday 17 October 2019 and national newspapers on Friday 18 October2019.“The first defendant falsely represented to the public that the saidcommissioners indicted me in their testimonies before the committee soas to justify my indictment by the 1st defendant which indictmentmembers of the first defendant had hitherto threatened to carry out."He added that the house committee and other lawmakers adjudged him tohave wasted public funds by procuring the buses and that the purchasewas done without the state's backing.The Lagos former governor said it was obvious that the lawmakers werebiased against him having regard to their pronouncements on the floorof the house by reason of which he believes that his right to fairhearing as guaranteed by the constitution had been seriouslycompromised by the defendants.Ambode, therefore, sought among others, the court’s declaration thatthe power of the house to pass a resolution under section 128(1) ofthe constitution to cause an inquiry into his conduct as governor issubject to the right to fair hearing as guaranteed by section 36(1).He also asked for a declaration that the resolution of the housesetting up a nine-man committee comprising the fourth to twelfthdefendants to investigate all transactions in respect of the 820 busessaid by the defendants to have been procured by him derogates from hisright as guaranteed by section 36(1) of the constitution and thereforeunconstitutional, null and void.The document added, "A declaration that having regard to theprovisions of sections 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the Appropriation Law of LagosState 2018, sections 8 and 9 of the Law which required the approval ofthe House of Assembly of Lagos State before certain expenditure ofmoney is incurred by the Executive Branch of the State is not inaccord with any provision of the Constitution and accordingly isunconstitutional, null and void.“A declaration that it is not lawful for the defendants to representor continue to represent to the public that the claimant, AkinwunmiAmbode, procured 820 buses in breach of budgetary approval.“A declaration that the powers of the first defendant under sections103, 128 and 129 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic ofNigeria, 1999 as amended does not include power to indict the Claimantas contemplated by sections 66(1)(h), 137(1)i and 182(1)i of theConstitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, as amended.“An injunction restraining the defendants whether by themselves, theirservants, agents and or representatives from compelling the claimant,in any manner whatsoever, to appear before the defendants pursuant tothe resolution passed by the defendants on 27 August 2019 or any otherresolution passed in respect of the subject matter of this Suit.“An injunction restraining the defendants whether by themselves, theirservants, agents and or representatives from representing or continueto represent to the Public that the claimant, Akinwunmi Ambode,procured 820 buses in breach of budgetary approval.”
