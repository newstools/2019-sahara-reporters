  The Kwara State House of Assembly has disclosed why it directed the seizure of the Alimi Chalet and a landed property popularly called Ile Arugbo, which was allegedly acquired by former Senate President, Bukola Saraki. It disclosed that it directed the seizure of the property because they belonged to the state government and that there was no evidence that Saraki paid for them. The Assembly, in a statement by the Special Assistant to the Speaker, Ibrahim Sheriff, said that the allocation of the property to the former Senate President by the last administration was a “violation” of the state’s law. The statement reads, “The Ile Arugbo had been erected on land originally meant for the expansion of the Civil Service Clinic and phase II of the state government secretariat without any evidence that anyone paid a dime to the government for the land. “The noise surrounding the affected property is politically motivated, as other public property unlawfully acquired are also being looked into. “We dare say that allowing impunity to stand, no matter who is affected and how long it had taken place, is a disservice to the state and its people. “Apart from the fact that the purported sale of the Alimi Chalet did not conform to the Kwara State Pension Law 2010, as amended, which incidentally was the brainchild of Saraki, we contend that there is no record anywhere that Saraki paid a dime to have the property transferred to him. “Aside from the three houses on over one hectare of land on Alimi Road supposedly given to Saraki under the state pension law, he also got N250m under the same law to build another retirement home for himself. “The said Alimi Chalet, which was gifted to him, is the property of the people of Kwara State and was never contemplated as a gift to former governors.”
