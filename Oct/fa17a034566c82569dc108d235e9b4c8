South Africa's President, Cyril Ramaphosa said it would be wrong to conclude that African nations, including Nigeria, going into trade agreements and cooperation with China and Russia is setting the continent up for modern colonialism.This statement came on the heels of the recently-concluded Russia-Africa Summit.In his weekly letter to South Africans made available to SaharaReporters, Ramaphosa said, "It would be wrong, as some have done, to label initiatives like the Russia-Africa Summit as an attempt by world powers to expand their geopolitical influence. Some have even argued that a number of countries in Africa are being led into a debt trap as they take up loans to fund a number of projects in their countries."One need only look at initiatives such as the Forum on China Africa Cooperation, which was last held in Beijing last year, to see that the focus is now on partnership for mutual benefit, on development, trade and investment cooperation and integration."Ramaphosa added, "We are ever mindful of our colonial history, where the economies of Europe were able to industrialise and develop by extracting resources from Africa, all the while leaving the colonies underdeveloped. Even now, African countries are still trying to stop the extraction of its resources, this time in the form of illicit financial flows through commercial transactions, tax evasion, transfer pricing and illegal activities that cost the continent over $50 billion a year."The message from African leaders at the Russia-Africa summit was clear: Africa needs greater levels of investment. It wants access to markets for its products, goods, and services. It wants to forge economic relationships of mutual benefit that develop our respective countries and uplift our people. The age where ‘development’ was imposed from outside without taking into account the material conditions and respective requirements of our countries is now past."Full Text Of LetterDear Fellow South African,Last week, I led a government delegation to the first Russia-AfricaSummit, convened in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi.For two days, heads of state from 43 African countries and their host,President Vladimir Putin, discussed how to increase trade andcooperation between the Russian Federation and Africa. The summit waspreceded by a Business Forum attended by investors and business peoplelooking at ways to scale up investment in various countries on theAfrican continent.The Summit was a sign of the growing economic importance of Africa onthe world stage. The summit took place on the back of the 7th TokyoInternational Conference on African Development in Yokohama in August.The G20 countries launched their Compact with Africa in 2017 topromote private investment in Africa.What we are witnessing is a dramatic rebalancing of the relationshipbetween the world’s advanced economies and the African continent. Wehave consistently affirmed that Africa no longer wants to be passiverecipients of foreign aid. African countries are developing and theireconomies are increasingly in need of foreign direct investment.It would be wrong, as some have done, to label initiatives like theRussia-Africa Summit as an attempt by world powers to expand theirgeopolitical influence. Some have even argued that a number ofcountries in Africa are being led into a debt trap as they take uploans to fund a number of projects in their countries. One need onlylook at initiatives such as the Forum on China Africa Cooperation,which was last held in Beijing last year, to see that the focus is nowon partnership for mutual benefit, on development, trade andinvestment cooperation and integration.China, Russia, the OECD countries and other large economies are eagerto forge greater economic ties with African countries because theywant to harness the current climate of reform, the deepening of goodgovernance, macro-economic stability and the opening up of economiesacross the continent for mutual benefit.With the IMF 2019 World Economic Outlook placing six of thefastest-growing economies in Africa, these advanced economies want totake advantage of the many investment opportunities on offer, be theyin infrastructure, energy, natural resource extraction, manufacturingor agriculture, and agribusiness.The opportunities for international investors will be further boostedwhen the African Continental Free Trade Area becomes operational nextyear. This interest in the continent’s rapidly growing economiesshould encourage African countries to engage with various trade blocson a more equal footing and on their own terms.We are ever mindful of our colonial history, where the economies ofEurope were able to industrialise and develop by extracting resourcesfrom Africa, all the while leaving the colonies underdeveloped. Evennow, African countries are still trying to stop the extraction of itsresources, this time in the form of illicit financial flows throughcommercial transactions, tax evasion, transfer pricing and illegalactivities that cost the continent over $50 billion a year.The message from African leaders at the Russia-Africa summit wasclear: Africa needs greater levels of investment. It wants access tomarkets for its products, goods, and services. It wants to forgeeconomic relationships of mutual benefit that develop our respectivecountries and uplift our people. The age where ‘development’ wasimposed from outside without taking into account the materialconditions and respective requirements of our countries is now past.Four months after he was released from prison, President NelsonMandela met with a group of business people in the US to mobilisesupport for the national democratic project back home. He laid out avision for South Africa’s economy, and of it “playing an importantpart in the regeneration and expansion of the economy of SouthernAfrica as a whole.”The private sector, both domestic and international, he said, willhave a vital contribution to make to the country’s economic and socialreconstruction. “We count on you,” he concluded, "to take the decisionthat you will become part, an important part, of the future SouthAfrican economy".President Mandela’s words affirmed what the nations of Africa havelong said: that we want trade more than aid. That we are determined tolift ourselves up, and that we neither expect nor want handouts.In his iconic 1963 speech on African unity, Ghana’s President KwameNkrumah lay down the gauntlet to gathered African nations to lookbeyond political independence towards economic independence.“Our economic independence resides in our African union,” he said.Nkrumah called on independent African states to harness theirfinancial structure and banking institutions for their nationaldevelopment and to use their material resources and human energies tomeet their own national aspirations.Next year South Africa assumes the chair of the African Union. It doesso at an opportune time, as the African Continental Free Trade Areacomes into operation. Not only will we have the opportunity to guideand oversee its implementation, but we will be taking on thisresponsibility in this new era of an emboldened Africa.It is an era of a confident Africa, of a growing Africa that knows itspotential and its worth. This is an Africa that is able to trade andengage on its own terms. An Africa that has finally come into its own.Best wishes,Cyril Ramaphosa
