Nigerian government through its Ministry of Health has broken thesilence over revelations that Long-Lasting Insecticide Nets (LLINs)distributed to Nigerians between April 2017 and October 2018 weresubstandard.The country had received eight million LLINs ('treated' mosquito nets)funded by two major international donors (the Global Fund to FightAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria & the US President Malaria Initiative).While this move was meant to contribute towards Nigeria’s efforts tocombat malaria, authorities admitted that some of these supposedlytreated nets were, in fact, substandard and non-compliant withrequirements.Investigations by SaharaReporters revealed that the nets were of theDawa-Plus model, a product by Pakistani manufacturer, Tana Netting,now rebranded as Moon Netting.Reacting to these findings, the National Malaria EliminationProgramme, a government agency attached to the Ministry of Health,claimed that only a small percentage of the eight million nets inquestion did not meet the required standards.However, the agency did not give a specific figure.According to NMEP’s National Coordinator, Dr. Bala Audu Mohammed,substandard nets were indeed delivered to Nigeria and distributedacross the country, nonetheless, he insisted there was no cause foralarm, advancing that the number was insignificant.“Yes, we received these nets, but it is just a small number which hadissues,” he replied to SaharaReporters. He further stated thatalthough the nets did not have the required dosage of insecticide, thephysical barrier is still there."He added, “It is like when doctors prescribed paracetamol, sometimesyou are asked to take 500mg which is the best, but if you use 200mg,it is not the best but you have still used the drug.”These concerns began to emerge in March 2019 when the donororganization, the Global Fund, issued a statement and shared it withall affected countries including Nigerian authorities which werenotified of quality issues with LLINs products of the brand DawaPlus2.0 commercialized by Tana Nettings Co. Ltd.“Twenty-one batches were found to have a content of deltamethrin ofless than 1.5 g/Kg which is the formal minimum threshold. Based on areview of QC data, the manufacturer concluded that a majority of netsmanufactured between January 2017 and April 2018 were not manufacturedaccording to the formulation. The products were therefore not fully inconformity with approved specifications,” the statement said.Nigeria, along with other large populations in Africa and Asia, hasbeen recipient countries of substandard nets, but the nationalcoordinator Mohammed defended the decision.“We might be creating another issue if we had made efforts to recallthe nets, so we decided to let it stay but made efforts to testssupplies from then on and we also made sure we stop purchasing fromthat manufacturer," he added, assuring that it was decided that futureprocurements would only be through eligible companies which prove thattheir nets are of the required quality and specifications.Regarding the controversy surrounding the manufacturers of the nets,Mohammed did not comment further on specific brands, nonetheless, hestated that once the substandard nets were found out, all stakeholdersincluding the World Health Organisation and other donor organizationswere informed by his agency, and some decisions have been made.“The most important thing is that we are no longer receiving nets fromthat company,” he stated.When asked whether he was aware the company had changed its name,Mohammed argued that it would not matter if they had changed the nameor not, stressing that they still have to improve their productquality and comply with global standards if they want Nigeria toconsider their product.Testing prior to distribution averts the danger of sharing substandardnets and avoids breaching trust and putting lives at risk, said theNMEP official, insisting that Nigerian authorities have put in placeadequate measures.“We have several testing facilities and we have quarantined over200,000 nets that we found not up to quality,” he explained.Mohammed further disclosed that his agency had distributed over 20million nets since 2017.According to the 2018 World Malaria Report, less than half ofNigerians have access to treated mosquitos.Meanwhile, over 190 million Nigerian women, men, and children areconstantly exposed to a serious danger of malaria infection,constituting 52% of the world’s population vulnerable to the disease.Over the past five years in Nigeria, the most conservative averageestimate of deaths due to malaria is around 70,000 per year.These statistics illustrate the immense challenges Nigeria faces inthe uphill struggle against malaria.Substandard solutions and low-quality products not only hamper theseefforts and cause setbacks, but also increase mosquito resistance andconsequently put more lives at risk.
