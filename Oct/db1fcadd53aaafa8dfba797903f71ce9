Omoni Oboli Jude Idaha, a Nigerian Canad-based scriptwriter, says he did not dragOmoli Oboli to court over Okafor’s Law's copyright infringementcontroversy.Speaking to SaharaReporters during the 2019 Ake festival, Idaha saidhe was just a witness to the case, and it was the owner of RaconteurProductions, Chioma Onyenwe, who took the case to court and had movedon with his life after his testimony in court.However, he stated that allegations made against Oboli were facts.“I was just a witness in the case. I wasn’t the one who took the caseto the court, Chioma did. For me, I just moved on. I don’t want to beloaned by Okafor’s Law— by that screenplay.“I think I’m bigger than it and I have done so much work after it thanfor me to go back on it. I have done plays, films, movies, writtenbooks, and I have won awards after that after. After my testimony incourt, I had nothing to do with it anymore, it was Chioma whocontinuously took it up but on the case, the truth will always remainthe truth,” Idaha explained.Idaha had accused Oboli, Nollywood actress, producer, and scriptwriterof copyright infringement on the movie, Okafor’s Law, claiming thatshe had stolen his story idea for the movie in September 2016.He alleged that Oboli took the work he had done regarding Okafor’sLaw, and developed it without giving him due credit.Afterward, it was gathered that Idaha had gone ahead to send a letterof demand and instituted a copyright infringement suit.But that did not stop Oboli who went ahead to fix March 31, 2017, as arelease date for the movie.The legal tussle resulted in a ban on the movie to be shown at cinemas.However, the ban was eventually lifted as a court presided over byJustice Ibrahim Buba ruled that what was exhibited by the plaintiff isthe script for a different movie, The Bet, and not Okafor’s Law andcould therefore not sustain his application for copyrightinfringement.While also speaking on the ills of plagiarism and intellectualproperty in Nigeria's movie industry, Idaha stated, “That is atestament of corruption in the society— first, on the individuallevel, and secondly on the structural level where people do not knowhow to protect their work and producers do not know what they shoulddo to respect intellectual property.“So there is first of all that ignorance in the system and then fromthat ignorance a few people who exploit others. I don’t think there iswidespread such that everyone wants to exploit the other person, justa few people who do not how to go about it. So it is up to theartist/producers guilds to educate their members especially those onescoming in now."An individual who comes in today as a fresher, in the next termsyears they will become an expert and a respected don. If you schooledthen when they came in, then obviously when they become experts theywill be able to respect the processes and the international laws thatapply to intellectual property.“Piracy, on the other hand, is something the government will have todo as pirates are just like mafias. Enforcement and Legislative lawsaround piracy should be looked into to bring culprits to book.”
