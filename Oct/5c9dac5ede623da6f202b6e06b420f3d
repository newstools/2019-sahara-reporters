Punchng  A former Minister of Education, Science and Technology, Ibrahim Abdullahi, has said that he would do anything to help President Muhammadu Buhari succeed. Abdullahi, who is also the Sarkin Bai of Gombe, made the statement in an interview with PUNCH. He said, “In our culture and in Islam, you obey your creator and your leaders and for now the leader of my country is Buhari. “Our relationship has become personal; it has moved to the family level and I will do all within my power to help him succeed.” Abdullahi said he participated in the two national conferences held at different times during the administration of former presidents Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan. However, he said implementation of the resolution from the conference would pull Nigeria apart despite call for the implementation from some quarters. He added, “It is because there is a clique pushing for that report. It will kill Nigeria if you implement it. If you force it on the people, it will be unfortunate.”
