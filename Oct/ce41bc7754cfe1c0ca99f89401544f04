The group, in a statement by its spokesman, O'Seun John, rebuked the federal government for going against its anti-corruption stand and sliding into totalitarianism.He said, "Mr. Fisayo Soyombo, the highly decorated investigative journalist who has been at the forefront of exposing the rots in our society is being surveilled for arrest by agents of the federal government for once again exposing the massive corruption in the police and prison system in the country."The now-viral undercover investigative work embarked upon by Mr. Fisayo which exposure seems to have triggered some powerful officers of the prison and police Services should be commended by all progressive Nigerian. What Mr. Fisayo has done will take months and huge resources to unearth should the federal government have lived up to its promise of ridding the system of corruption."Mr. Fisayo is a national hero that puts himself in dangerous circumstances to protect whatever is left of the sanity of this country. Instead of having him fear for his life and that of his family, the federal government should be concentrating resources on arresting and prosecuting all those who have turned our institutions to barter."This planned arrest is distasteful, nauseating, appalling and against every known convention of civility.”
