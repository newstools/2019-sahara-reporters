Justice Simon Amobeda of the Federal High Court sitting in Calabar, Cross River State, has fixed Friday, October 4, 2019 for ruling on the bail application for journalist and rights activist, Mr Agba Jalingo. Justice Amobeda, who is presiding over the case, will also rule on the preliminary objection on the bail application filed by the prosecution counsel, Mr Dennis Tarhemba. The judge fixed the date after listening to argument of both the prosecution and defence counsels. Jalingo is facing trial for alleged treason, terrorism and attempt to topple the Cross River State Government. One of Jalingo’s counsel, Mr James Ibor, told journalists that he was happy with the proceedings of the day as he was optimistic that Jalingo would be granted bail in line with the rule of law and respect for his rights. He said, “I am very impressed that finally the court had taken our application for bail. “We can only be hopeful that it will go our way. The issue of bail is at the discretion of the court.” Jalingo was arrested and is being prosecuted for publishing a report exposing how Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River approved and immediately diverted N500m meant for Cross River State Microfinance bank. Jalingo spent 34 days in police detention before he was arraigned on September 25, 2019. He has since been remanded in prison custody following an order of the court.
