 Two United States and a British doctor were on Monday announced as this year’s Nobel Prize for Medicine winners. They were rewarded for their research into a molecular switch that determines how cells in the body reacted to fluctuating levels of oxygen. Their findings are helping pharmacists develop treatments for conditions such as heart failure, anaemia, cancer, and other ailments that affect how the body receives oxygen. Secretary-General of the Nobel Assembly, Thomas Perlmann, announced on Monday that William G. Kaelin Jnr, Sir Peter J. Ratcliffe and Gregg L. Semenza, would share $913,000 for their work. He said, “They were extremely happy, and happy to share the prize with each other.” So far, 25 Africans have won the Nobel Prize award and the last to win the Nobel Prize for Medicine is Sydney Brenner of South Africa.
