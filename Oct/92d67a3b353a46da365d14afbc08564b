SaharaReporters Media Former Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Alfa Belgore, shouldface sanctions for his alleged role in the $9.6-billion fine imposedon Nigeria by a London court, says anti-corruption group, Human andEnvironmental Development Agenda (HEDA Resource Centre).Justice Belgore was said to have been a key witness to Process andIndustrial Development (PID), a private firm that sued Nigeria over abotched gas contract leading to the $9.6bn judgement debt.HEDA said in a petition dated September 16 and addressed to PresidentMohammadu Buhari that the former CJN flouted the Nigerian constitutionby providing the legal springboard for the imposition of fines thatalmost equal 20 percent of Nigerian foreignreserves.A copy of the petition was also sent to the Minister of Justice andAttorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami.In a statement by HEDA' s Chairman Mr. Olanrewaju Suraju, madeavailable to SaharaReporters on Wednesday, the group said the formerCJN should be prosecuted immediately by the Code of Conduct Bureaubefore the Code of Conduct Tribunal for violating Section 5 of theConstitution.HEDA said by providing supporting evidence for P&ID and proffering theexpert advice for the Irish company, the former CJN violated theprovisions of the Constitution and also put asunder Nigeria’sstrategic national interests. It urged the Federal Government to probetheincidence to establish whether the CJN' s action was for personal gains."It can be concluded, without equivocation, that drafters of theConstitution understood the weight of the offices occupied by theprohibited officers and the potential implication of actions such astaken by the former CJN," the group stated.HEDA said there was a clear case of conflict of interest whichviolates the Code of Conduct for Public Officers.It refers to Section 1 of the Code of Conduct for Public Officerswhich states that a public officer shall not put his or her person ina position where personal interest conflicts with his duties andresponsibilities.It noted that Section 5 of the Code of Conduct for Public Officers ofthe 1999 Constitution prohibits former Presidents, Vice Presidents,Chief Justices of Nigeria, governors and deputy governors from workingfor the interests of foreign companies or enterprises.HEDA added, "Chief Justice holds strategic positions in Nigeria. He isa member of the National Council of State Chairman of the NigerianNational Honours Award Committee and Central Working Group Vision20.20.20."Reports claimed Justice Belgore testified as an expert witness beforethe arbitration tribunal in the UK’s Business & Property Courts, forthe Irish firm, P&ID."It was reported that as a result of his expert advice, in which helaid claims to a painstaking analysis of Nigeria’s laws and exploitingits shortcomings, cited case laws for the benefit of the firm whichresulted in a humongous arbitral award of $9.6 billion (N3.2 trillion)againstNigeria."The genesis of the award commenced from the accusation laid againstthe Nigeria Government by P&ID for breach of a 2010 Gas Contractagreement," stated HEDA."It was on his status as a former CJN that the UK tribunal acceptedMr. Belgore’s opinion with two members of the tribunal – Lord Hoffmanand Sir Anthony Evans – ruling that the British Virgin Island firm isentitled to $6.6 billion in damages plus interest until the amount ispaid."Also, a third member, Nigeria’s former Attorney General, Chief BayoOjo, was said to have given a dissenting opinion, saying P&ID shouldbe paid not more than $250 million."In August 2019, the UK’s Business & Property Courts granted P&ID’srequested enforcement of the 2013 award against Nigeria by thethree-member arbitration tribunal.The tribunal relied on the Arbitration Act 1996 (England and Wales)and the Nigerian Arbitration and Conciliation Act 2004.Suraj said, "If the award is executed, according to HEDA, theconsequences will be unpleasant for every Nigerian."As a result of this breach, the former CJN should be removed withimmediate effect as Chairman of the National Merit Honour AwardCommittee. He should be stripped of his National Honour of GrandCommander of the Niger."The act committed, according to HEDA, is grave and amounts to a breachof the Code of Conduct for Public Officers, thereby violating theprovisions of the Constitution.Suraju added, "As a former CJN, he is a member of the Nigerian Councilof State, which is chaired by the incumbent President and is made upof past Presidents and Head of States of the country, former ChiefJustices, President of the Senate, Speaker of House ofRepresentatives, all governors of the 36 states of the country, theMinister of Justice and the Secretary to the Government of theFederation."
