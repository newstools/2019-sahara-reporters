The Delta State Government has been accused of encouraging a crisis inOgwashi-Uku with the endorsement of a faction of the Okonjo royalfamily.The state government had last week confirmed HRM Ifechukwude Okonjo IIas the Obi of Ogwashi-Uku, saying all relevant traditional rites bythose concerned have been concluded.It based its decision on a Supreme Court judgement, saying the statehas no reason to stop the presentation of staff of office to themonarch.The oldest member of the Okonjo royal family and claimant to thethrone, HRM Obi Nathan Okonjo, in a chat with The Guardian inOgwashi-Uku at the weekend, wondered why government hastened to madethe endorsement when it was aware of existing factions, courtesy ofhis letters to relevant state institutions, and the state is adefendant in an ongoing litigation with suite number 0/39/2018, whichhas been adjourned to October 28 this year.He said: “We are already in an Ogwashi-Uku High Court and the stategovernment is the sixth defendant on the perpetual injunctionrestraining Ifechukwude and anybody from the lineage of my latecousin, Prof. Ben Okonjo, from ascending to the throne of Obi ofOgwashi-Uku, as they are not favoured to become the Obi of Ogwashi-Ukuby virtue of the judgement in suit number 0/5/85.“The matter came up on Wednesday at Ogwashi-Uku High Court, and theirlawyer, Dr. Nwabuoku was there to represent the family of the lateProf. Ben Okonjo. That is a preemptive suit we filled last year, toprevent what is happening today.“It is a declaration that a fraction of Umu Obahai, to the exclusionof others, including the claimants, cannot, by virtue of election,overrule the Order of Court in suit number 0/5/85 mentioned above andthe age-long tradition of succession by primogeniture of theOgwashi-Uku people.”“We are taught not to confront the government, but we are definitelytaking this case to its logical conclusion. Because what they aretrying to do is to instigate crisis in Ogwashi-Uku, and we will nothonour them with that, as we are very civilized people.”
