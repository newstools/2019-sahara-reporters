The Nigerian Bar Association, Warri Branch, Delta state, has written apetition against the Chief Judge, Justice Marshal Umukoro and thePresident of the Customary Court of Appeal, Justice Stella Ogene, forallegedly appointing their family members as high court judges in thestate without following due process.Challenging the appointment, the NBA, in a petition addressed to thechairman, National Judicial Council, (NJC), Abuja, signed by MichaelAsugo, chairman and John Aruoture, secretary, accused the chief judgeof breaching the guidelines of the NJC for the appointment of judges.The petition said, "By a letter dated 6th June 2019, the Nigerian BarAssociation, Warri branch was called upon by the Judicial ServiceCommission of Delta State to comment on the suitability or otherwiseof thirty-six shortlisted persons for appointment as Judges of theDelta State Judiciary."Prior to this letter, there was no notification to the branch or anyother branch of the NBA in Delta State as provided for in the NationalJudicial Committee (NJC) guidelines for the appointment of judges.Notwithstanding the lack of notification, by its letter dated 24thJune 2019, the branch forwarded its comments on the suitability orotherwise of the short-listed persons for appointment as judicialofficers to the JSC."In the course of time, the branch became aware of some seriousdeficiencies in the exercise such as lack of any assessment of theintellectual suitability of the candidates, scrutiny of their recordssuch as cases conducted by them or judgments delivered by them, etc."It added, "The screening of the short-listed candidates that wasconducted by the JSC on the 16th of July, 2019 was a sham that couldnot possibly determine the suitability or otherwise of any candidatefor appointment as a judge of the high court."When the names of the persons allegedly picked for appointmentfiltered into the public domain, it became clear that the list ofpersons forwarded by the JSC for the consideration of the NJC is madeup of some handpicked candidates and the blood relations of the ChiefJudge of Delta State, Hon. Justice Marshal Umukoro and the Presidentof the Customary Court of Appeal, Hon. Justice S. O. N. Ogene."The NJC guidelines for the appointment of judges were designed toensure that only suitably qualified candidates are appointed asjudges. It was also designed to ensure that the process of appointmentis transparent and credible."However, contrary to the clear provisions of Rules 3(1)(a)(i) of theNJC procedural rules (the “Guidelines”), no call was made for theexpression of interest by suitable candidates by way of public noticeplaced on the website of the Judicial Service Commission/ Committeeconcerned, Notice Board of the Courts and Notice Boards of Nigeria BarAssociation Branches."Contrary to rules 3(1)(a)(iii) of the guidelines, no letter waswritten by the JSC to “the Chairman of every branch of the NigerianBar Association in the state concerned, asking for nomination ofsuitable candidates for the proposed judicial appointment andrequesting that he/she brings to the notice of suitable candidates thecall for expression of interest by each of them."The NBA noted further, "This means that only a select few who arehighly connected were informed of the commencement of the process.This cannot be the intendment of the rules referred to above. Therewas also a flagrant disregard of the germane provisions of Rules3(2)(3)(4)(6)(8) of the guidelines."Following the petition, the association disclosed that it had rejectedthe purported list generated and forwarded by the JSC to the NJC andtherefore called for an in-depth review of the entire exercise by theNJC.
