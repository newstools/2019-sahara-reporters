Ahmad Lawan President of the Nigerian Senate, Ahmed Ibrahim Lawan, has called for the introduction of anti-corruption teaching in schools. Lawan gave the suggestion in Abuja on Tuesday while declaring open the third EFCC National Capacity Building Workshop for Justices and Judges in collaboration with the National Judicial Institute. He said, “We should start educating our children in schools, basic education secondary level and even tertiary level, on the ills of corruption in any society. “Therefore, it is a task that requires that we review the current curricula of our basic education particularly to include something like what corruption means, the ills and the responsibility on every citizen to be part and parcel of the fight against this scourge.” Lawan who reassured the EFCC and ICPC of total support from the senate in the fight against corruption, also pointed out the need for the police to be involved with the fight against corruption.
