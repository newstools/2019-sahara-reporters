Suspects accused of allowing female genital mutilation to be carriedout can face prosecution in the United Kingdom, regardless of where inthe world the procedure took place, says the Crown ProsecutionService.Following on from the first-ever UK conviction for FGM in Februarythis year, which saw a woman sentenced to 11 years in prison for FGMoffences, the CPS said it had expanded its guidance to helpprosecutors and police successfully bring more perpetrators tojustice.The refreshed guidance also gives clarity on the line betweenso-called “designer vagina” operations and FGM to guide prosecutors,given the rise in popularity in these procedures.Jaswant Narwal of the CPS said: “Female genital mutilation is asickening offence that can have a serious lifelong physical andemotional impact on victims.“We want to send a strong message that this crime does not have to becarried out in the UK for people to be prosecuted by the CPS - we willseek justice for people affected by this horrific practice. There isno hiding place.“We hope this new guidance will give victims, police, and prosecutorsthe confidence and practical guidance they need to bring moreperpetrators of this traumatic abuse to justice.”According to the CPS, the new guidance introduces a series ofpractical updates that are informed by CPS’ experience prosecutingthese offences.It includes extra guidance to investigators on which types of expertevidence can be secured to help build a robust prosecution case tobring before the courts, considering pathology, gynaecology, andexpert evidence of ritual and religion.Furthermore, the guidance offers clarity on the position of genitalpiercing and genital cosmetic surgery under FGM legislation."In theory, some cosmetic vaginal surgery, such as labiaplasty, couldfall under the definition of FGM provided for by the 2003 Act.Although there have been no prosecutions, the guidance has beenupdated to direct prosecutors to consider whether the medicalexceptions provided for by the 2003 Act apply in cases of labiaplastyor piercing."If they do not, prosecutors should go on to consider public interestfactors, including the age of the victim, whether they provided fullyinformed and free consent, the level of physical or mental harm causedand the impact on the individual’s quality of life now and in thefuture."The guidance confirms that piercing female genitalia will not usuallyamount to FGM," a recent statement by the CPS disclosed.It added that advice on ways to support victims of FGM through thecriminal justice system had also been updated.It includes further direction on discussing Special Measures at anearly stage in all FGM cases where the victim is to give evidence, theselection of interpreters who have a complete understanding of thelanguage and dialect of the victim and their culture, and thatcross-examination is performed in a sensitive manner.
