Today is exactly 2,000 days since the abduction of 276 schoolgirlsfrom Government Girls Secondary School in Chibok, Borno State, onApril 14, 2014, but President Muhammadu Buhari and his regime havesaid no word on concrete plans to bring back the remainingschoolgirls.Daily Trust reports that the town of Chibok has never been the samesince the infamous abduction of schoolgirls that attracted globalattention to it over five years ago.While some of the schoolgirls have been found, at least 113 are stillmissing, and it is not yet clear if they are still alive.It is also not clear whether they have been married off, or underwhose custody they are, considering the changes that occurred in theranks of the Boko Haram, the violent group that abducted them duringthe sole leadership of Abubakar Shekau.Hours after the abduction on April 14, 57 of the girls found their wayback home, and some years later, a few others escaped captivity, whilethe government negotiated with the abductors and freed over 100. Agroup, the Abducted Girls Parents’ Movement for Rescue, in itsrelentless effort to secure freedom of the remaining 113 captives, hasbeen reaching out to relevant authorities and non-governmentalorganizations that played one role or the other in the previousnegotiations.Women leader of the group, Mrs. Yana Galang, whose daughter is amongthe 113 still in captivity, lamented that concerned authorities areallegedly not much concerned about freeing their daughters. “We werefrequently being invited to Abuja for talks while the government wasfacilitating negotiations that led to the freedom of those over 100girls,” she said.“But since a batch of 83 girls was released two years ago, nobody hasever contacted us again for any talks about rescuing the remainingones,” she said. “I have suffered a lot from insurgency,” RachaelDaniel, mother of Rose who is still in captivity, said.“My husband, Daniel, was first killed along Dikwa highway. And later,my daughter, Rose Daniel, 17, was kidnapped at GSS Chibok. “Life isfrustrating; I think life is not fair to me; I am always depressed,”she said.Mr. Ayuba Alamson doubles as a guardian of his abducted sister andspokesman for parents of Chibok girls.The sister, Hadiza Kwagui, was, however, among the first set ofescapees while been led into Sambisa forest by their abductors on thefateful day.Alamson expressed another form of grief and dejection suffered by thefreed girls and their parents, following the government’s allegedfailure to fulfil its promise of sponsoring their education.His sister, Hadiza, sat for her secondary school examination, full ofhope that the government was sponsoring her higher education.“Unfortunately, since they wrote their WAEC and NECO at BethelInternational School in Jos, they have been abandoned to date,”Alamson said.“In fact, Hadiza is in the village now and some of her friends havegotten married out of frustration. Some of these girls are now farmingin the village despite what we heard that they had been offeredscholarships to study up to degree level,” he lamented.However, Yana Galang, who is the woman leader of the parents’association of the abducted Chibok girls, thanked the federalgovernment for securing the release of more than 100 of the abductedschoolgirls but said those who are yet to see their daughters arestill grieving.She said her daughter, Rifkatu Galam, is still with the insurgents,adding “My daughter was 18 when the abductors took her away.”
