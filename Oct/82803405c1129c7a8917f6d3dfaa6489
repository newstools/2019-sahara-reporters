Former Central Bank Governor, Charles Soludo Prof. Charles Soludo, a former governor of the Central Bank ofNigeria, says magical miracle centres can be a stumbling block tohaving and supporting an effective health system in the country.Soludo, therefore, called for a collective response in tackling poorhealthcare systems, poverty and other major challenges facing thecountry.Soludo made the call at the 26th Annual Lift Above PovertyOrganisation Development Conference in Abuja on Tuesday.He said, "We must think through how to mobilize our churches, mosques,traditional and professional institutions as forces for good inhealthcare delivery."These constitute the largest forum to reach the largest segment ofthe population."Most of the leaders in these organizations will easily understand andcooperate."But some, especially some of the magical miracle centres which feedupon the Siamese challenges of the most vulnerable, poverty andill-health might feel challenged."According to him, public policy cannot be effective without thecitizens being demanding and vigilant, noting that individuals andnon-state actors accounted for about 75 percent of healthcareexpenditures.The former CBN governor said added that a sustainable strategy of thefuture was how to mobilize this dominant but latent force to transformthe delivery system.Soludo added, "However, the conversation must begin and ultimately,the dominant force of science and reason will triumph oversuperstition and ignorance."Once the citizens become conscious of the fact that they will onlyget the quality of healthcare they persistently demand andconscientious leaders emerge to organize and mobilize action forchange, the healthcare delivery system wonâ€™t be the same again."
