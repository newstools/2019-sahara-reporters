He said it was their right to ask for timeto study the electronically generated evidence in line with theAdministration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA).The presiding magistrate, Abdullahi Ilellah, therefore, adjourned thecase until 19 November.Abbo, representing Adamawa North Senatorial District, is a PeoplesDemocratic Party's legislator.He admitted on July 3 that he was the one in the video and apologizedto the woman assaulted.He was charged on July 8 for criminal force and assault which iscontrary to section 263 and 264 of penal code law.
