 Governor of Lagos, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has signed the 2020 budget of the state into law. Nigerians in the past have criticised Lagos State's budget for its lack of transparency. The move comes less than 24 hours after the Lagos State House of Assembly approved N1.168trn being the 2020 budget for the state.
