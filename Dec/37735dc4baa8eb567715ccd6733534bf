2 Days Ago The Senate has now said it would not be declaring the seat of Kalu vacant even as he spends his time in prison. The Senate said, “There is no reason to declare his seat vacant. This is not the first time that such a thing would happen. “There is no provision in the constitution that says the seat of any senator facing prosecution or convicted at a lower court should be declared vacant. “He still has the opportunity to appeal the case. “Even the tenure of a former governor Joshua Dariye, who has been in prison for some time now, ran its course until the end of the 8th National Assembly. Nobody declared his seat vacant.  “The Senate President cannot declare the seat of Kalu vacant. It is against the law."
