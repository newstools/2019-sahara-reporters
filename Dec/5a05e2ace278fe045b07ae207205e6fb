  Argentine football maestro, Lionel Messi, has won the 2019 Ballon d'Or award. The event, which took place in Paris, France on Monday, attracted some of the biggest stars in football. The latest feat brings Messi’s total of the prestigious award to six Ballon d'Or – one more than closest rival – Cristiano Ronaldo. Messi had earlier in the year won the European player of the year award ahead of Liverpool’s Virgil Van Dijk and Ronaldo. The skillful Argentine is regarded by some as the greatest player football had seen and with Monday’s win, he further reinforces that reputation.
