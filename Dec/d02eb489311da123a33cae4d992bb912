Founder and General Overseer of the Living Faith Church Worldwide popularly known as Winners Chapel, Bishop David Oyedepo, has again condemned the Nigerian Government under President Muhammadu Buhari for its failure to make the country better for the people. Oyedepo, who was preaching at the ongoing Shiloh 2019 programme, also asked the government to focus on curbing hate act in the country rather than hate speech. He said that the reason the people had continued to complain and condemn the administration of President Buhari was because he was not doing well. The popular preacher said, “If government was doing well, the people would not complain.”
