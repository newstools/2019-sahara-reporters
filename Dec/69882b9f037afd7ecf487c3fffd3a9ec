  Six persons died as a mining pit collapsed on Tuesday at Zawan Community in Jos South Local Government Area of Plateau State. Gwottson Fom, member representing Jos South Constituency in the state’s House of Assembly, confirmed the incident to the News Agency of Nigeria on Wednesday. Fom said the ages of the victims ranged from 20 to 27, describing the incident as “sad and unfortunate”. The lawmaker noted that the victims died engaging in illegal activity. He said, “We know that these young persons died carrying out an illegal activity but it is obvious unemployment led them into doing it. “People go out of their way to do things considered illegal just to fend for themselves and their families. “This is not time to apportion blames but it is sad and unfortunate that a community will lose six vibrant youths in a day. “If people must engage in mining activities, they should do it the right way. They must ensure they are licensed to do it.”
