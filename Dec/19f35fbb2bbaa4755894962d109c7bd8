  The Nigerian Senate is set to investigate the invasion of the Federal High Court, Abuja, by operatives of the Department of State Services last Friday. The secret police had stormed the place to effect the rearrest of pro-democracy campaigner and journalist, Omoyele Sowore, who was standing trial in a case brought against him by the Nigerian Government. Sowore was first arrested on August 3, 2019 by the DSS for calling on Nigerians to take to the streets in peaceful demonstrations to demand a better country from the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari. The government is accusing him of insulting President Buhari and planning to bring down his regime. He was rearrested by the DSS on Friday less than 24 hours after being released on bail after 125 days in detention. Chairman of Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters, Opeyemi Bamidele, moved the motion for the probe of the court invasion by the DSS. Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, instructed the committee to begin legislative procedure on the matter and report next week.
