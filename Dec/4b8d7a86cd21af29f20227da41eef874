Facts have imaged on the real reason Taraba State governor, Darius Ishaku, forced Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Abel Diah, to resign. SaharaReporters exclusively gathered that Diah incurred the wrath of Ishaku following his insistence on securing complete autonomy for the state's legislature. Governor Ishaku, it was learnt, was disappointed with Diah's unyielding commitment to realising the autonomy of the Taraba House of Assembly. A top government source in the state revealed that "Oga (the governor) was disappointed to learn that Diah vigorously canvassed for legislative autonomy when the Conference of Nigerian Speakers visited President Muhammadu Buhari recently." Though the meeting between President Buhari and the 36 Speakers was held behind close-doors, it was nonetheless revealed that top on the agenda was autonomy of the assemblies. Sources said that Governor Ishaku decided to teach Diah a bitter lesson for his position on legislative autonomy. Many of the stateâ€™s legislators were coerced into joining the pro-impeachment camp by the executive but when tensions gathered steam, Diah had no option than to resign his position as Speaker on Sunday. Earlier, SaharaReporters had reported how Governor Ishaku set aside N200m to mobilise lawmakers in the state to impeach Diah.
