The Ijaw Youth Council worldwide has called on President  Muhammadu Buhari to act immediately to stop the reign of impunity by security agencies in the desecration of justice in Nigeria. In a statement, President of IYC, Eric Omare, said it was on record that the Buhari administration had one of the worst records of disobedience of court orders and desecration of the judiciary. The group's position followed the invasion of the Federal High Court, Abuja, on Friday by operatives of the Department of State Services trying to forcefully arrest pro-democracy campaigner and journalist, Omoyele Sowore. Omare said, “We strongly condemn this act of impunity by security agencies under the Buhari administration. "The IYC is worried that the Presidency is mute in the face of this sacrilege on the judiciary. "It would be recalled that when the DSS carried out similar acts of impunity by invading the National Assembly when Vice President,  Yemi Osinbajo, was the Acting President,  Osinbajo promptly acted by sacking the then Director-General of the agency and brought some level of sanity into the security architecture. “However, we are shocked that a worst act of impunity was carried out under the watch of President Buhari and he has decided to keep mute. "This is a worrisome development and gives the impression that these acts of impunity have the blessings of President Buhari. “Consequently,  we call on President Buhari to quickly act to stop the ongoing impunity by security agencies against the rule of law and desecration of the judiciary. "Nigeria is fast sliding into a state of lawlessness under the watchful eyes of President Buhari and he must act now to save our dear country and democracy."
