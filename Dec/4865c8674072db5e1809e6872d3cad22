It added, “Salaries are paid as at when due, pensions are being remitted, all current obligations are being met and the company is prepared for AMCON exit. “The management’s effort is bearing fruits with two more aircraft expected to return from C-checks in the next few weeks - one at the end of the year, and another in January.” Chief Executive Officer of Arik Air, Capt. Roy Ilegbodu, in the statement hinted that the airline over the weekend received additional two aircrafts to boost its operations.
