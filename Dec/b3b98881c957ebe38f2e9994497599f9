The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has arraigned Aisha Wakil popularly known as ‘Mama Boko Haram’ over an alleged N66m fraud. Wakil was arraigned alongside one Tahiru Daura on a three-count charge before the Borno State High Court, Maiduguri, on Wednesday. EFCC is prosecuting Mama Boko Haram following a petition alleging that she collected maize grain worth N15m in 2018 but had refused to pay. The maize was supplied to her by AMTMAT Global Ventures, whose managing director wrote the petition against her and her foundation, Complete Care and Aids Foundation. Count two of the charges against her reads, “That you Tahiru Saidu Daura, while being a programme manager of Complete Care and Aid Foundation, and Aisha Wakil, being the CEO of Complete Care and Aid Foundation on September 7, 2018 in Maiduguri within the jurisdiction of this honourable court dishonestly induced Ali Tijjani, the CEO and alter ego of AMTMAT Global Ventures to deliver to you processed maize grains (biski) valued at N15m, which you are yet to pay and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 320(a) and punishable under Section 322 of the Penal Code Cap 102 Laws of Borno State.” Mama Boko Haram and her co-defendant pleaded not guilty to the charges.
