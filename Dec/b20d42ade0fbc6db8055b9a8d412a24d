  The Staff of the National Identity Management Commission could decide to embark on strike action on December 31 if steps towards improving the working conditions in identity enrolment centres across the country are not taken. The Association of Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria had issued a 21-day ultimatum in November, asking government to improve the facilities used by the NIMC. Following the expiration of the deadline, the union said it would take a decision at the end of the year, according to a report by PUNCH. “We have decided to give government till December 31, 2019 for further discussion. "But if nothing positive comes up, nobody should blame us for any action taken,” Chairman of ASCSN, Abuja branch, Lucky Asekokhai, said. He added, “We have been on this issue for a long time. Because of the insincerity of the management of the commission, we issued an ultimatum in accordance with labour laws which had elapsed. There is no reason for people that work in a critical agency that keeps data of the identities of Nigerians to be subjected to a deplorable condition of service."
