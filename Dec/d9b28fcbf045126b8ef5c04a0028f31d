 The Lagos State Police Command has arrested at least 50 suspected members of the dreaded “One million boys” gang said to be responsible for most crimes in the state. The suspects were arrested during a raid of criminal hideouts in Lagos. It was learnt that the hoodlums were picked up by policemen attached to the Special Strike Force set up at the instance of the Commissioner of Police in Lagos, Hakeem Odumosu. Spokesperson for the police in Lagos, Bala Elkana, said the suspects were responsible for a series of violent crimes and attacks in different communities and neighbourhoods. He said, “The operations are mostly intelligence-driven, collating actionable information about the activities of such miscreants, their membership and hideouts and taking the battle to their doorsteps. “Eleven suspects were initially arrested and charged to court. Items recovered from them include two locally made pistols, 11 axes, nine cutlasses, four daggers and charms. “The 50 suspects in custody are being profiled. The Commissioner of Police uses this medium to send a strong warning to members of such violent gangs that the command will pursue them, subdue them and bring them to justice. “Parents are advised to monitor the activities of their children. The onslaught will be sustained until sanity is restored to our streets and neighbourhoods.”
