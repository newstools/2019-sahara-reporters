 Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of the Federal High Court, Abuja, has taken a swipe at the Department of State Services for constituting itself into a parallel court and flouting orders. She lambasted the DSS for asking the sureties of detained human rights activists, Omoyele Sowore and Olawale Bakare, to come forward after she had signed a release warrant. Ojukwu, who confronted DSSâ€™ lawyer, Hassan Liman, during the commencement of trial in a case of treason brought against the two activists by the government, said that the court had the final say on the matter.
