Omoyele Sowore
BBC The Nigerian Presidency has denied ordering the rearrest of pro-democracy campaigner and journalist, Omoyele Sowore, on Friday at the Federal High Court in Abuja. Sowore was rearrested by the Department of State Services less than 24 hours after he was released from 125 days of arbitrary detention. The DSS is under the direct control and supervision of the Presidency. In a statement on Sunday, spokesperson for President Muhammadu Buhari, Garba Shehu, denied granting permission to the DSS to carry out the rearrest.Shehu said, "The DSS does not necessarily need the permission of the Presidency in all cases to carry out its essential responsibilities that are laid down in the Nigerian constitution – which was the foundation for the restoration of democracy in our country in 1999."However, it should not surprise anyone who has followed his actions and words that Sowore is a person of interest to the DSS."He added that Sowore was rearrested for calling for a revolution, an alleged offence for which he has been granted bail twice by the Federal High Court in Abuja. Sowore was first arrested on August 3 for calling on Nigerians to pour out to the streets in peaceful demonstrations to demand a better country from the administration of President Buhari. The trail in a case brought against him by the government was ongoing at the Abuja court on Friday when the DSS stormed the place to forcefully take him away.
