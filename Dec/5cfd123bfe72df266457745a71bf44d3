The European Union has lamented the growing spate of conflicts in Nigeria, saying it could increase incidents of gender-based violence. Ketil Karlsen, EU Ambassador to Nigeria, said this at an event held in Abuja to commemorate the 2019 Human Rights Day. Karlsen spoke on law enforcement, civil liberties and the rule of law in Nigeria. She said, “In a country like Nigeria where we see conflicts, poverty, inequality and some social and cultural structures, these exacerbate further the risk of gender-based violence.”
