  The Federal High Court in Lagos has granted permission to a former governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, to travel abroad for medical treatment. Fayose is being prosecuted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission for an alleged N2.2bn fraud. Following an application by his lawyer, Olalekan Ojo (SAN), Justice C.J. Aneke for the second time, granted Fayose permission to go abroad for treatment. The judge had in July first granted Fayose permission for a foreign medical trip. The prosecuting counsel for EFCC, Rotimi Jacobs (SAN), did not oppose Friday’s request. After granting the travel permission, Justice Aneke adjourned till January 16, 2020 for continuation of trial. Fayose is being prosecuted alongside a firm, Spotless Limited. In the charges, the EFCC alleged among others, that Fayose, on June 17, 2014, “Took possession of the sum of N1, 219, 000,000 to fund your 2014 gubernatorial campaign in Ekiti State, which you reasonably ought to have known formed part of the proceeds of an unlawful act, to wit criminal breach of trust/stealing.” The ex-governor was also alleged to have on the same day "received a cash payment of $5,000,000 from Senator Musiliu Obanikoro, the then Minister of State for Defence, which sum exceeded the amount authorised by law and you thereby committed an offence contrary to sections 1 and 16(d) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2011 (as amended) and punishable under Section 16 (2)(b) of the same Act." The defendant pleaded not guilty.
