  More agitations have continued to trail the rearrest of Omoyele Sowore by the Department of State Services less than 24-hours after he was released on bail. Sowore had spent 125 days in custody of the DSS with the secret agency disregarding court orders for his release. Despite excuses given by the Presidency and the DSS for the court Invasion, prominent Nigerians have continued to condemn the incident and calling for the immediate release of Sowore as ordered by the court after meeting stringent bail conditions. Bukola Oreofe, speaking for the Free Sowore Now Movement, knocked the DSS for not complying with the court order, urging Nigerians outside the country to join a mass rally to press for the release of the journalist. Oreofe said, “We condemn in unequivocal terms this executive lawlessness and persecution of a journalist and human rights activist. “To speak up against tyranny and the continued violation of the rights of 'Yele, please join us for a protest rally." The rally, according to the organisers, would hold at the Nigerian Consulate, New York, United States, on Thursday, December 12, 2019.
