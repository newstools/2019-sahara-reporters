 Governor of Kano State, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, is set to appoint a chairman of the stateâ€™s Council of Emirs. This is coming following the creation of new emirates in the state. According to a statement by the Chief Press Secretary to Ganduje, Abba Anwar, the governor said the four new emirates created are for the development of the state. Ganduje has been in a running battle with the Emir of Kano, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, who was also a former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria. The new emirates created by the governor include Bichi, Karaye, Rano and Gaya. Ganduje argued that the law gave him the right to appoint the chairman of the Council of Chiefs, which is the central council for the five first-class emirs, apart from their individual emirate councils.
