The Peoples Democratic Party has said it will be heading to the election tribunal on Monday to challenge the victory of Smart Adeyemi, candidate of the All Progressives Congress declared winner of the rerun of Kogi West Senatorial poll. The Independent National Electoral Commission had declared Adeyemi winner of the exercise following a court order that nullified the previous election. Dino Melaye of the PDP was declared winner of the first election conducted in the district. However, the court said the election was marred with electoral malpractices and ordered a fresh exercise. PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, told PUNCH that they will challenge the victory of Adeyemi at the tribunal. He said, “We are going to the tribunal. We are going to file our application at the tribunal. We won the election. “We will file the appeal hopefully on Monday. The party and the candidate are going to court together. “It is not about Dino Melaye. It’s about Nigeria and our electoral system.”
