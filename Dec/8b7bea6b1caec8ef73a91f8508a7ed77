  The Nigerian Government has approved N4bn for the completion of the Kwara-Osun link road. Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, disclosed this at the end of the Federal Executive Council’s meeting in Abuja. Fashola said part of the road contract was awarded by the previous administration. He said, “They relate first to Ajase/Epo/Offa/Erinle Road in Kwara; that is the road that connects Kwara and Osun. “The approval was for the 18km section that completes the entire length of 26 km of the road. All that was awarded in the previous administration was just 8km of 26km. “So, what we have done now is to award the 18km so that the full stretch of 26km is now under contract for the purpose of completion. “That comes to a sum of N4.027bn for the 18km stretch; the previous contract is still going on, so, this is an addendum to that contract. “What we awarded now was a variation of N825m. This is to expand the original contract by three kilometres go link Osogbo town– the built-up section because it is supposed to by-pass the town. “This is the 3.4km that the governor requested when I went on the nation-wide road tour. He asked that we should help connect to Osogbo town. “So, going through procurement and all of that we finally got the approval today for N825m to include that part.”
