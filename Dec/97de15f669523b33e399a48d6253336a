  Agba Jalingo, a journalist detained by the Cross River State Government on allegations of treason and terrorism, has asked the Federal High Court in Abuja to reassign his case from the current trial judge, Justice Simon Amobeda, to another judge. Jalingo was arrested in August after he published an expository piece on the governor of Cross River, Ben Ayade. He was denied bail and remains detained. Jalingo cited an exclusive audio conversation published by TheCable where Justice Amobeda said Jalingo's life was in his hands as reason his case must be reassigned to another judge. He added that the judge promised to treat him like Ken Saro-Wiwa by handing him a death sentence. He pleaded to the chief judge to ensure he gets the right to a fair trial by reassigning his case.
