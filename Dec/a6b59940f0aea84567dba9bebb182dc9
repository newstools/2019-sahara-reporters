  The Jigawa State Government has said that it would start the payment of the N30,000 minimum wage to its workers in December. Governor Muhammad Abubakar said this while signing the minimum wage payment agreement in Dutse, the capital, on Wednesday. The governor, who was represented by deputy governor of the state, Umar Namadi, said, “I salute the NLC for understanding our situation and agreeing to what we’ve signed today. “Also, I want to assure you that we will not fail you now as we haven’t failed you in the last four years. “I am, therefore, directing the Head of Service and Secretary to the State Government to ensure the payment of the minimum wage in December salary.” Workers from level 01 to 06 would receive N30,000 minimum wage, while level 07 and above would receive consequential increment of 23 per cent to 12 per cent, the News Agency of Nigeria reports.
