  The Supreme Court has upheld the election that produced Abdullahi Sule as governor of Nasarawa State. In the ruling on Wednesday (today), Justice Mary Peter-Odili dismissed the appeal of David Ombugadu and the Peoples Democratic Party. The seven-man panel held that the appeal by Ombugadu lacked merit, thereby affirming Sule's election as governor.
