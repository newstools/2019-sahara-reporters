  Suspected Internet fraudster, Ismaila Mustapha popularly known Mompha, has been released by the Economic and FInancial Crimes Commission from detention after meeting his conditions of bail. The Federal High Court in Ikoyi, Lagos, had earlier granted Mompha bail in the sum of N100m in bond. He was arrested on October 19, 2019 at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, and remanded in EFCC custody following a court order. However, he instituted a fundamental rights enforcement suit against EFCC for detaining him beyond the constitutionally stipulated days without charging him to court. In the commencement of trial, Mompha also pleaded not guilty to a 14-count charge bordering on fraud offences. He was subsequently granted N100m bail which was hard to meet. Mompha has now been released upon fulfilling the condition.
