  Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara has called on the people of the state especially Muslims to pray to Allah to bring his wrath upon those abusing the Holy Qur’an. Matawalle made the call on Monday in Gusau, the state capital, during the opening of the state chapter of the 2019 Qur’anic recitation competition, Musabaka, according to the News Agency of Nigeria. He said, “This prayer is necessary because the perpetrators are committing a high level of immorality and their provocation and sin can cause a lot of problem to us as citizens. “So we should pray so that Allah’s punishment will not affect the innocent. “At our level as a government, I have set up an investigative committee and anyone found to have had a hand in it, however highly placed in the society, will be punished as prescribed by Islamic laws.”
