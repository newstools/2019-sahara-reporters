  Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has renamed the Onikan Stadium as Mobolaji Olufunso Johnson Arena. The renaming was announced by the governor during a ‘Day of Honour’ event organised to celebrate the exit of the first Military Governor of Lagos State, Brigadier-General Mobolaji Johnson. Paying tributes to the late Johnson, Sanwo-Olu described him as "a man who saw the future and worked to achieve the Lagos of our dreams". He said, “In whatever role we knew him, the first and longest serving military administrator of Lagos State stood out as a special person for his leadership and charismatic personality. “If anyone was qualified to be addressed as ‘an officer and gentleman’, it was Brigadier-General Johnson. Despite his imposing frame, he was as gentle as a dove. “He never threw his weight around, even though he was a man of power. “As a man of authority, he was never authoritarian. Though a soldier, he never ruled with an iron hand; he was compassionate.” The Sanwo-Olu and his deputy, Dr Obafemi Hamzat, led members of the state’s Executive Council and high-profile dignitaries to the event to honour the life and times of the deceased.
