  Nigeria’s Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, said in a post on Twitter that Nigeria’s law on civil defamation was an insufficient punishment for hate speech. Keyamo’s comments came after a report on Fulani herdsmen abducting passengers from an Owerri, Imo State-bound bus from Abuja went viral. He said, “For those against regulation of social media, what should happen to this purveyor of totally fake news that can set a whole tribe against another? “Can a civil suit for defamation cure this? Certainly not. There must be punishment for this type of behaviour, but not death penalty.”
