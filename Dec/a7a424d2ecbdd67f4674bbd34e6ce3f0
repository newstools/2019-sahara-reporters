 Convicted former governor of Abia State, Orji Kalu, has urged the court to grant him a post-conviction bail over his failing health. The lawmaker representing Abia North Senatorial District at the National Assembly, was on December 5 convicted of N7.1bn fraud and sentenced to 12 years imprisonment by the Federal High Court, Ikoyi, Lagos. Kalu, who has been in prison since that pronouncement, in an application on Tuesday claimed to be battling serious health challenges, praying the court to release him on bail to attend to his condition. The former governor also said that if he is kept in jail, the interest of his constituents would be in jeopardy. He is the Chief Whip of the Nigerian Senate. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission however, opposed the post-conviction bail application. On December 14, the anti-graft agency marked properties belonging to Kalu following a forfeiture order of the Federal High Court, Ikoyi, Lagos. The Sun newspaper and Slok Nigeria Ltd were among Kaluâ€™s properties marked by the EFCC. The former Abia State governor is facing prosecution over N7.5bn belonging to the state he allegedly misappropriated while presiding over the affairs of the state.
