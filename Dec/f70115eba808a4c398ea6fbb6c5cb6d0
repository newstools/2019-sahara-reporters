The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria has warned President Muhammadu Buhari against setting up Igbos for possible genocide in the country. The group said that the President has kept silent while his officials and core Northern supporters had embarked on massive anti-Igbo sentiments. HURIWA alleges that presidential officials are adopting discriminatory policies, which may ignite genocidal attacks on Igbo natives residing outside their geopolitical region. In a statement by its National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko, and National Media Affairs Director, Zainab Yusuf, HURIWA fingered Transportation Minister, Rotimi Amaechi, and Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, as two key officials that have by words and actions exposed the Igbo to hate crimes. The group also identified a number of organizations and individuals also stirring hate against the Igbo. HURIWA said, â€œThe President should act fast as a statesman to stop the trend to avoid a replication of Rwanda type genocide in Nigeria. "The trend has assumed a worrying dimension demanding swift institutional response from the Federal Government of Nigeria to stop any genocide from happening." The group also stressed that President Buhari should not neglect the primary duty of the government, which is to protect lives and property for citizens.
