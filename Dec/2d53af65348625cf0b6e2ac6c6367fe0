Earlier, a member of the Ondo Diocese had confirmed the abduction of the two priests. “The two priests were kidnapped around the Elegbeka area. “I learnt the armed men stopped their vehicle on the road and pretended like security agents. "They disguised like they were doing a stop and search on the road before kidnapping them."

Joseph said the Ose Divisional Police Station in charge of the jurisdiction had not been brief. He said, "I can't confirm this as at now."
