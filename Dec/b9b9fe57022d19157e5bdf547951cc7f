  The police in Lagos have arrested a 19-year-old home help for attempting to poison her  93-year-old boss with a popular insecticide. According to the News Agency of Nigeria, the teenager was alleged to have put poison into Christiana Ogunshina’s tea in their Mende, Maryland, residence with a view to killing her. Spokesperson for the Lagos State Police Command, Bala Elkana, said the incident happened last Saturday. He said that whenever the old woman’s daughter went to work, she would request her maid to stay with her mother pending her return. Shortly afterwards, the old woman prepared her morning tea, closed the cup for some minutes and left for her room while the 19-year-old was there. Elkana said that as soon as the old woman left the room, the suspect allegedly opened the cup containing the tea and added the poisonous substance. Elkana added that the suspect however, did not know that the old woman’s personal maid, who was in the kitchen at the time had seen her adding the substance into the tea. He said that after the maid had emptied the cup, she discovered some substances at the bottom of the cup, which she showed to old woman. Elkana said the old woman invited her eldest son, one Abayomi Ayobami, who perceived the content in the cup and suspected it to be a poisonous substance. The PPRO said, “Abayomi Ayobami reported the case at the Anthony Police Station at about 1:00pm on Saturday. “The police visited and searched the house. They arrested the suspect as well as took away the empty cup that contained the poisoned tea. “The suspect confessed to the offence. “She alleged that the old woman was always shouting at her and that she was tired of her tantrums, so she decided to poison her that day.”
