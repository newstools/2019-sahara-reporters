   One Samuel Eze has been arrested in Enugu for allegedly posing as a police officer. According to the spokesperson of Enugu State Police Command, Ebere Amaraizu, Eze was arrested on Friday, November 29, by operatives on surveillance activities along Mgbemena in Coal Camp. Eze, when arrested, was dressed in a police uniform and had spray teargas, handcuff and a jackknife with him.
