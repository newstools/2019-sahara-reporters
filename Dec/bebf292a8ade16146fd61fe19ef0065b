Chris Coons A member of the United States Senate from Delaware, Chris Coons, has condemned the rearrest of pro-democracy campaigner and journalist, Omoyele Sowore, by the Department of State Services at the Federal High Court in Abuja on Friday less than 24 hours after being released on bail by the agency. Sowore was standing trial in a case brought against him by the government on Friday morning when DSS operatives invaded the court and forcefully took him away. According to Coons, the situation leaves him deeply concerned. In a post on Twitter on Tuesday, the lawmaker said, "I'm deeply concerned by the harassment and repeated detainment of Nigerian activist, journalist, and former presidential candidate, Omoyele Sowore. "I urge Nigerian security services to respect due process and the rule of law, release Sowore per his bail terms, and launch an investigation into his rearrest. "I'm concerned that this case is representative of closing of political and media space in Nigeria. "Civil society leaders and human rights defenders should be celebrated, not persecuted, in Nigeria and around the world."
