 Security has been beefed up around the Federal High Court in Abuja over the trial of human rights activists, Omoyele Sowore and Olawale Bakare, who are facing treasonable felony and cyberstalking President Muhammadu Buhari. Heavily-armed policemen have been stationed within and around the court premises while officers of Explosive Ordinance Squad were seen screening the court room. Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu had on November 6, 2019 adjourned the matter for trial to December 5 (today). The Department of State Services had refused to release the activists despite meeting bail conditions on two separate occasions. Recall the DSS through its lawyer, Hassan Liman, had on November 27, 2019 filed an application seeking an order of the court to vary its pronouncement made on October 4, 2019 upon the request of the defendants and their counsel to be remanded at the facility of the DSS instead of the Nigerian Correctional Service, Kuje.
