 Non-governmental organisation, Centre Against Injustice and Domestic Violence, has said that the Department of State Services desecrated the temple of justice by invading the Federal High Court, Abuja, to rearrest pro-democracy campaigner and journalist, Omoyele Sowore, on Friday. Speaking through its Executive Director, Gbenga Soloki, the CAIDV called on the Chief Justice of the Federation to summon the Director-General of DSS for questioning over the unholy display of power by his men. Soloki said, “The Chief Judge of the Federation should summon the DG of DSS and ensure he produces those that invaded a court of law so that the appropriate punitive measures could be meted out to them to serve as deterrent.” The group also noted that failure to do so will invariably lead to more acts of impunity in future. Soloki also appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to call the leadership of the DSS to order and stop them from "ridiculing our country by the naked display of power". He stressed that since the accused had been admitted to bail, any other issue or matter should be left under the purview of the court rather than the unruly manner in which he was abducted in court by gun-wielding men of the secret service.
