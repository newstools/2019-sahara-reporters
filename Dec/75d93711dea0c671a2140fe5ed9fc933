  The Independent National Electoral Commission has declared Smart Adeyemi, candidate of the All Progressives Congress, winner of the Kogi West Senatorial district election. Dino Melaye, candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, was defeated by Adeyemi with 88,373 votes against his 62,133 votes. The commission had declared the election inconclusive, stating that the number of “registered voters in 53 polling units of the 20 registration areas in the zone where elections held were cancelled”. After the initial election, both candidates had respectively polled 80,118 and 59,548 votes. The margin of 20,570 votes between the two candidates was far less than the 43,127 registered voters in the 53 polling units where elections were cancelled, hence the rerun. Adeyemi is returning to the Senate five years after he lost the seat to Melaye at the 2015 election.
