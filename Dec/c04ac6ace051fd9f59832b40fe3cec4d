Otunba Gani Adams, leader of the Odua People's Congress The Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, Otunba Gani Adams, has described the rearrest of pro-democracy campaigner and journalist, Omoyele Sowore, on Friday at the Federal High Court, Abuja, by operatives of the Department of State Services less than 24 hours after he was released on bail after 125 days in detention as a national tragedy. Adams said the situation that played out at the court has only indicated that Nigeria had lost its drift as a democratic nation. According to him, the incident showed that the rule of law was gradually dying, while the Federal Government remains helpless. He said, “With what happened at the court, it reminded me of the dark era of the military but ironically, the present government under President Muhammadu Buhari is likened to the military junta of late Sani Abacha where the military brigande held sway for years. "I have been watching events as they unfold, but I am saddened that the event that transpired in the court was a testimony that Nigeria had a long way to go. “The Department of State Services had failed to respect the rule of law and it was a sad reminder of the military era. "This is not the democracy we fought for between 1993 and 1998. “I remembered vividly as activists and pro-democracy groups, we put our lives on the line to ensure that our dreams for this democracy became a reality. “Now, democracy is here but we have lost touch with the ideals of a democratic setting as it is practised in another climes. "Therefore, I am using this opportunity to advise President Buhari not to allow these set of people at the corridors of power to use his name and the Presidency to perpetrate evil that could later discredit his name in future.”
