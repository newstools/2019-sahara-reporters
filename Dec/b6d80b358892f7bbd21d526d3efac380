Itse Sagay Chairman, Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption and a staunch supporter of President Muhammadu Buhari, Prof Itse Sagay (SAN), has condemned the Department of State Services over the rearrest of Omoyele Sowore. The DSS rearrested Sowore in a Gestapo manner at the Federal High Court, Abuja, on Friday, less than 24 hours after he was granted bail, leading to criticism of the government from all around the world. Not impressed by the explanation given for the rearrest of Sowore, Sagay blasted the DSS, saying the agency had failed to give a clear reason for the act. Sagay added that the secret service owed Nigerians an explanation for invading the premises of a Federal High Court in Abuja to rearrest Sowore. He, however, exonerated President, saying the DSS doesn't need the approval of Buhari before doing their job. Sagay said, “I agree that the DSS (operatives)  have their job. They don’t need the approval of the Presidency to do their job. So, no one should blame the Presidency for anything the DSS does. “However, the rearrest of Sowore looks bad on the surface in the sense that the man was released a day earlier and he was in court the next day to answer the charges and he is arrested. “I feel that Nigerians are entitled to an explanation. It’s not something you can do and keep quiet. It’s not alright. There is something wrong in that. They could have a good reason but they should tell us what that reason is. “They cannot be quiet about it and if they are justified, I will be the first to say yes. But they cannot do it and keep quiet and expect everybody to accept it."
