  Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, has said that he has no regrets siting the University of Transportation in Daura, Katsina State. Amaechi said this during the commissioning of the university in Daura, hometown of President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday, according to the News Agency of Nigeria. He said, “When we sited a factory at Kajola, there was no noise, nobody debated about it, nobody abused us for it unlike the site for the university. “Daura is in Nigeria, it is not in any other part of the world. It is not in Niger Republic, Biafra or Mali, it is in Nigeria. So, what is wrong in siting the University of Transportation in Daura? “I have no regret siting this university where I have sited it, it is not because I want to get any gain.”
