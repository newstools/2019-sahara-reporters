  Minister of Transportation and former Rivers State governor, Rotimi Amaechi, has said that he would refuse any offering of pension if offered such by the state government. He said this on Twitter after a Federal High Court in Lagos declared it unconstitutional for former governors occupying public offices to keep receiving emoluments from their states. He said, “I have never requested for or collected one kobo as pension from River State Government. “If offered, I will politely decline and request that the money should be given to Rivers State pensioners. “I do not believe that I should receive pension as ex-governor while serving as a minister.” A Federal High Court in Lagos had on Wednesday declared as illegal the practice of former governors now federal lawmakers and ministers to still be earning pensions in their previous capacity from their states.
