  Nigerian-born British heavyweight boxer, Anthony Joshua, on Wednesday said that he will not celebrate if he defeats Andy Ruiz and regains his world titles during their rematch in Saudi Arabia on Saturday. Joshua, according to the AFP, aims to win back the IBF, WBA and WBO titles that he lost to Ruiz in a shock defeat in June inside New York’s Madison Square Garden. Joshua said he was “hungry, determined and focused” as he appeared alongside Ruiz in a press conference in Diriyah, close to the Saudi capital Riyadh. He said, “I am not here to put on a show, I am here to win. “When I regain those belts… I am going to keep calm, stay focused. It’s not a time to celebrate. It’s a time to keep that challenger mindset and move on to the next target.”
