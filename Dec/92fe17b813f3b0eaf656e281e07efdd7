SaharaReporters Media Opeyemi, wife of the pro-democracy campaigner and journalist, Omoyele Sowore, has condemned the rearrest of her husband by the Department of State Services inside the Federal High Court, Abuja, on Friday. Sowore was rearrested by the DSS less than 24 hours after he was released following another order by Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of the same court. Reacting to the latest development, Opeyemi described the rearrest of her husband as "gross misuse of power and outrageous display of lawlessness". She said, “Today was a turning point in Nigeria's history, unlike anything its democracy has ever seen. “In just 24 hours, the world witnessed Nigeria's democracy disintegrate further with a gross misuse of power and outrageous display of lawlessness. “This government has shown us repeatedly their irrational conduct and extreme inability to follow the rule of law.” Speaking further, she said that Nigerians must all come out to hold the government accountable while also calling on global outcry to ensure his freedom. She added, “We don't have the luxury of time, it's urgent that we hold this government accountable. “We cannot go at this alone, Sowore's life depends on a global outcry, your advocacy and intervention.”
