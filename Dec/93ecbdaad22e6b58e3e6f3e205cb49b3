  The Department of State Service has rearrested and detained activists Omoyele Sowore and Olawale Bakare popularly known as Mandate. The two men were rearrested by operatives of the secret police on Friday hours after they were released on bail on Thursday evening. They were standing trial at the Federal High Court, Abuja, on Friday in a case earlier brought against them by the Nigerian Government when DSS operatives stormed the place and disrupted proceedings, leaving to hours of standoff and tension around the place.  Lawyer to the activists, Femi Falana (SAN), confirmed the development to SaharaReporters, saying that they had not been furnished with the new charges the DSS had brought against Sowore and Bakare.
