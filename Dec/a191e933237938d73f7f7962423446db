A former media adviser to Goodluck Jonathan, Ruben Abati, has faulted political parties in Nigeria for having no means of monitoring the commitments made by their members elected into public offices. Speaking on the controversy over invisible constituency projects and a failure by members of the legislature to open constituency offices, Abati said politics in the country was driven by poverty. He went on to claim political parties do not also have a plan for poverty reduction. Abati said, “Political parties have no structure or means for monitoring the performance or the commitment of their members in public positions. That must change.” Abati who switched to politics from the media, observed that lawmakers and their constituents have created a symbiotic relationship. The rule of the union imposes it on the would-be senator/honourable to organise parties, share food and drinks, give out transport fare and other sundry things in exchange for oxygen cylinders of hope. According to him, this type of relationship is nurtured by the fact that “Political parties have no poverty reduction strategies”. He however, feels that, “Nonetheless, no politician should run away from the people because they seek help from him or her. “Constituency work is part of the lawmaker's mandate. To build a positive reputation, he must connect with citizens and other politicians.”
