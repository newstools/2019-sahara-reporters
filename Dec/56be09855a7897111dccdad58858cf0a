  The Supreme Court has validated the election of Nasir el-Rufai as Kaduna State governor. A panel headed by Justice Centus Nweze dismissed the appeal filed by Mr Isa Ashiru of the Peoples Democratic Party challenging the declaration of el-Rufai as winner of the March 2019 governorship election in the state by the Independent National Electoral Commission. The apex court held that the appeal lacked merit as Justice Nweze read out the unanimous judgment of the panel.
