Joshua Alobo
ChannelsTV A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, Joshua Alobo, has condemned the Federal Government over the rearrest of pro-democracy campaigner and journalist, Omoyele Sowore. Alobo, who is the President, International Human Rights and Development Centre, while speaking on Channels Television on Monday, also accused the APC of being the originator of hate speech. He said, “APC, in which I am a chieftain, originated hate speech. "Look at what happened (under Goodluck Jonathan), even Lai Muhammed and the rest, nobody was arrested. “A lot of showbiz was going on during the Jonathan administration, they don’t look at it as a threat to the government. "What is Sowore? They are just making him popular. “If a media practitioner cannot express his opinion, then what will he do? This is a man that has the pedigree of activism right from university." Sowore was rearrested by operatives of the Department of State Services on Friday, having only been released on bail on Thursday night after 125 days in detention. His arrest had drawn criticisms from all across the world.
