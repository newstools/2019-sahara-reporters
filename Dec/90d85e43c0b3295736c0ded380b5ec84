Yinka Odumakin Pan-Yoruba group, Afenifere, has knocked the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration for its defense of the rearrest of Omoyele Sowore at the Federal High Court, Abuja, by the Department of State Services despite being on bail. The group also condemned the DSS for the invasion of the court. Afenifere claimed the government was becoming totalitarian, condemning the statement issued by the Presidency on why Sowore was rearrested. Yinka Odumakin, National Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, in a statement noted that if there was any sign Nigerians needed to know that the country had slipped into the abyss of totalitarian rule, it was the “unfortunate statement by the Presidency on Sowore”. Afenifere also likened the invasion of the court by the DSS as a “coup against the judiciary”. The statement reads, “A truly democratic regime would have condemned the barbaric conduct of the DSS in court on Friday with a promise to investigate it. “But this Presidency ignored the sacrilege of desecration of the temple of justice and went after Sowore whom it describes as a ‘person of interest’ to the DSS. "Does it occur to them that what DSS did on Friday was a coup against the judiciary? “The statement shows this administration is far too gone in its way of riding roughshod over all that we hold dear as a nation. "If Nigerians do not assert constitutionalism with all peaceful and democratic means, this country may well be resting in pieces in the grip of dictatorship and arbitrariness. “To see our Presidency patronising Boko Haram in the context of Sowore galls and stinks to high heaven.”
