 Participants at the ongoing National Human Rights Summit in Abuja has told President Muhammadu Buhari that citizens may be forced to resort to self help if people's rights continue to be violated in the country. The warning followed the invasion of the Federal High Court in Abuja by operatives of Department of State Services on Friday to rearrest pro-democracy campaigner and journalist, Omoyele Sowore, less than 24 hours after he was released on bail by the agency. Queen Agba, a participant at the event, said, "It goes against the constitution and security agencies cannot arrest within the cort premises especially when a case is ongoing. "I think is a breach in law and something that need to be addressed and if we don't do that on time we may not be able to handle the impact in future." Adding his voice to the call, Eze Onyekpere said, "It shouldn't have happened in the first place and our expectation is that the judiciary should come together. "The media and citizens should come together to simply say enough is enough. "If we allow this to continue, we shall soon be in the mortal danger of having constitution abrogated." Another participant, Afolabi Olajuwon, said, "It was a very terrible situation and experience in the Nigerian context. "If this persists, it can turn to self defence where every man can violate the rules and do whatever they like. They can take the laws into their hands because this is not democracy."
