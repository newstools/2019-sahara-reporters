  Ondo State-based activist, Gbenga Ajongbolo, has condemned the rearrest and detention of pro-democracy campaigner and journalist, Omoyele Sowore, by operatives of the Department of State Services at the Federal High Court in Abuja on Friday. Sowore was arrested less than 24 hours after he was released on bail after spending 125 days in detention despite two court orders calling for his freedom during that time. According to Ajongbolo, who recently won the Ondo State Citizens Advocate of the year award 2019 and dedicated the prize to Sowore, the invasion of the court by the DSS was a gross violation and abuse of the Nigerian constitution. He commended Sowore for standing with oppressed Nigerians and encouraging them to speak truth to power. He said, “This government has been disobeying court orders and had never given the judiciary the autonomy to operate hence the type of undemocratic scenes we saw during the illegal rearrest of Omoyele Sowore at the Federal High Court in Abuja. “I am happy that right-thinking Nigerians are condemning this, and we too must never be quiet but jointly condemned this atrocious act. “So, as a mark of honour for his activism in ensuring a better Nigeria and exposing malfeasances in government circle, I dedicate my award to Sowore, who has committed over 30 years of his life fighting oppressors.”
