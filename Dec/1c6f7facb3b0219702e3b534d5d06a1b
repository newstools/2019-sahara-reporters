  Heavyweight champion, Andy Ruiz Jr, on Monday said that all the pressure will be on Anthony Joshua when they meet in the rematch of their fight in Saudi Arabia on December 7. Ruiz, who was born in the United States but fights as a Mexican, caused one of boxing’s biggest upsets in New York in June when he handed Joshua a first defeat to win the WBA, IBF and WBO crowns in New York, according to the AFP. The pair will fight the rematch on Saturday in Diriyah, close to Saudi capital Riyadh, in a hotly-anticipated contest dubbed “Clash on the Dunes”. Ruiz said, “We’ve got to see where he’s at because all the pressure is on him. The pressure isn’t on me because I followed my dream, made my dreams come true. “Of course I want more though – I want the legacy of Andy Ruiz Jr.” Joshua said he was “comfortable” and “very relaxed” ahead of the rematch. “I am just going to win. I know I can do it,” Joshua said. “I was this close last time, so next time I won’t mess up,” he added.
