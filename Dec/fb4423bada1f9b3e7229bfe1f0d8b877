The Nigerian Government says it would stop the importation of petroleum products by 2023. This mandate was announced by the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mele Kyari, during the signing of the Condensate Refinery Strategy Programme Front End Engineering Design, according to Channels Television. The strategy is expected to deliver 20 million litres of petrol when itâ€™s completed. Nigeria, an oil-producing country, has been heavily dependent on the importation of petroleum products since its four major oil refineries have been under-utiliaed. Kyari explained that President Muhammadu Buhari was concerned that as an oil-producing country, Nigeria was one of the highest importers of petrol in the world. In 2017, the Nigerian Government planned to stop the importation of fuel by 2019 with the approval of a new National Oil Policy by the Federal Executive Council.
