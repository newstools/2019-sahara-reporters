 A Coalition of Civil Society Groups has given President Muhammadu Buhari a 14-day ultimatum to release Omoyele Sowore and all prisoners of conscience.Â The groups under the coalition include the Center for Democracy and Development, Transition Monitoring Group, Enough Is Enough, Concerned Nigerians, Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre and others. The groups said the shrinking media and civic space in the country calls for concern by all Nigerians. The coalition condemned the attack on judiciary and free speech aimed at silencing voices of dissent. Speaking at a briefing with journalists in Abuja on Monday on behalf of the coalition, Convener of Enough Is Enough, Yemi Adamolekun, said that they would mobilise Nigerians and occupy the National Human Rights Commission Commission and shutdown the country until those conditions were met. The five demands according to him are, "President Muhammadu Buhari to show accountability and address the nation on his commitment to the rule of law and human rights. "The release of all illegally detained persons by Department of State Services as reviewed by Amnesty International. "That the government obey all pending court orders. "An investigation of the officer who violated protocols and circumstances leading to the rearrest of Omoyele Sowore. "Unconditional release of Omoyele Sowore. "If these five demands are not honoured within 14 days, we call on patriots across Nigeria to join us as we occupy the National Human Rights Commission offices across the country as it is legally mandated to protect Nigerians and also report to the Presidency."
