 A popular Christian leader in Ondo State, Adewale Giwa, has likened the government of President Muhammadu Buhari to a military government regime due to its continued disregard for human rights. Giwa, Senior Pastor of The Second Coming of Jesus Christ Gospel Church in Akure, said Buhari’s government had continued to give Nigeria a bad name in the international community. The cleric condemned the rearrest of pro-democracy and journalist, Omoyele Sowore, the operatives of the Department of State Services inside the Federal High Court in Abuja on Friday, less than 24 hours he was released on bail after 125 days in detention. Giwa described the invasion of the Federal High Court by the DSS as undemocratic. He said, “Nigeria needs total deliverance from the hands of the few people who are hell-bent on destroying the country. "Nigeria has now become a global laughing stock. Do we still have a sitting President in Nigeria? “Does he read newspapers? Does he know what is happening in the country? If the head is sick, the whole body is sick also. "Lies have an expiry date but the truth will last longer without anyone stressing himself to explain to the world. "We can identify the official of the DSS from a civilian. Why are these people turning black to white? How long would they continue to deceive us? "These political leaders no longer know what they do. They don’t know how to govern people anymore. "All they now rely upon is power they can use to mistreat the people. “We don’t know whether we are under the military or civilian rule anymore. They are scaring us, they don’t want us to talk again.”
