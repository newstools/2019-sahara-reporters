  A 500-level law student of Rivers State University has been stabbed to death by an unknown suspect. The 24-year-old lady, who attended Salvation Ministry until her death, was killed in her apartment off-campus. According to a Twitter account, @phsabithetin was allegedly raped before she was killed. Another source, who spoke to the PUNCH stated, “Her killers broke into her room near the Rivers State University campus’ main gate. The compound is close to other houses; we only knew her as Matilda and she was 24 years old. She danced ballet at the Salvation Ministry during our papa’s 57th birthday celebration. “When the news broke on Tuesday, her friends and other final year law students could not attend classes due to the shock. I heard that Matilda used to live with two other female students, who were not at home the night when the incident happened.” Spokesperson for Rivers State Police Command, Nnamdi Omoni, confirmed the incident. Omoni said, “That she was raped is not the true reflection of what happened. But I can confirm that a young woman of about 24 years, who was staying off-campus, was killed on Tuesday by assailants. “The assailants stabbed her to death. We have recovered the corpse and it is in the mortuary. We have spoken to her family and investigation is ongoing as the matter has been transferred to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department. No arrest has been made so far.”
