6 Days Ago "MEND as key stakeholders in the resolution of the Niger Delta question, no longer supports the use of force in our agitation for a better deal for our people. "We are still committed to respecting the unilateral ceasefire declared by the group since May 30, 2015. "We therefore received news of the attack on Goodluck Jonathan's residence with shock and disbelief given the publicly known fact of our political differences with the former President. "On this occasion however, we express solidarity with the former President and call on relevant security agencies to leave no stone unturned in the search for the masterminds of the senseless and cowardly attack and bring them to justice."
