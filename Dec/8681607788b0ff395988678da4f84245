 The Centre for Democracy and Development has called on the Nigerian Senate to throw away the bill seeking to regulate the social media by government. The group, in a statement by its Director, Idayat Hassan, on Thursday said, “The provocative legislation, which has passed second reading in the Senate, is an attempt to use the legislative process to muzzle freedom of expression.” CDD said the growing intolerant political climate must give way to a free society where journalists, activists and dissenting voices are free to contribute to democracy. The group urges the Senate to disregard the entire bill and look for alternative approaches to the problems of hate speech and the spread of false information on social media.
