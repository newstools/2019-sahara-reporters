  Former Vice President of Nigeria, Atiku Abubakar, has accused President Muhammadu Buhari's administration of not investing enough resources in developing the country’s education sector. He said that the regime's poor budgetary provision to education in the past four years will make it difficult for the country to defeat terrorism, which according to him is caused by illiteracy. Speaking at a ceremony hosted by American University of Nigeria on Saturday in Yola, capital of Adamawa, the former Vice President described education as "a pathway to exit the dubious record of being the world's headquarters of extreme poverty". Atiku pointed that Buhari's less than 10 per cent budgetary allocation to education was below the 15 per cent minimum recommended for developing countries by the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation. He explained that Nigeria cannot grow if government does not invest in education. He said, "The reason why the country is experiencing insecurity is because of poverty which is the product of illiteracy and it is a cycle that the country can only break by educating the citizenry. “Investment in education will take Nigeria to the level of unprecedented development.”
