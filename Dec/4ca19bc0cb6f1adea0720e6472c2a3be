  Around 100 fake professors have been unearthed by the National Universities Commission in Nigeria, according to the Executive Secretary of the commission, Prof Abubakar Rasheed. Rasheed said that details of the fake professors had been posted on the NUC website and the commission had to send the names to the various universities for verification. This was contained in a recent bulletin of NUC, a report by Daily Sun said. The NUC boss disclosed that the updated version of those documents would be published by December 2019 and that professors in their respective universities were made to upload their resume on the website which was used in the compilation of the directory and helped identify fake ones in the system. He encouraged  vice chancellors to have accurate statistics of staff, students and other components in their respective universities. Rasheed stressed that the fight against fake professors was a collective responsibility, adding that lecturers were no longer permitted to teach in more than two universities, while minimum teaching of eight hours should be enforced.
