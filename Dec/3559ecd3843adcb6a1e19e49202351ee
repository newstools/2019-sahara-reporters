Alfa Babatunde Following the arrest of founder of Sotitobire Miracle Centre in Akure, Ondo State, Pastor Alfa Babatunde, by operatives of the Department of State Services on Tuesday over a missing child in his church, some high-profile Nigerians are already begging to mount pressure on the secret police to release the cleric from custody, SaharaReporters can confirm. A source in the DSS, who confirmed the development to SaharaReporters, disclosed that top politicians and traditional rulers in the state are among those currently lobbying for the cleric’s release. Babatunde was arrested following a petition by parents of the missing one-year-old boy known as Eniola Kolawole, who went missing at the crèche section of the church during a service on November 10, 2019. The source said, “He (Pastor Alfa) is still with us in Akure and has been allowed access to his lawyer. “Some traditional rulers and politicians have been sending emissaries and trying to lobby top officials of the DSS to release the cleric based on recognition. “Investigation is ongoing and we may invite other top officials of the church for interrogation.” Already, activities at the church had been paralysed following the arrest of Pastor Babatunde by the DSS.
