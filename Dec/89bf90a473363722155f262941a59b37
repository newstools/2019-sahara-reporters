  The United States has seized a jet belonging to a Nigerian indicted in multi-million dollar international fraud. The jet was seized at the Peachtree DeKalb Airport in Georgia with a sealed sign placed on it. The sign reads: “This property is under detention and/or seizure, United States Customs Service.” The jet belonging to an unnamed Nigerian was searched for drugs. Thor Whitmore, special agent, said, “It’s like a game of chess, we try to stay on top of their next move.” The Homeland Security in 2019 has seized more than five tons of drugs, 200 guns and $4,375,457 cash. As federal agents went through the plane, the accused was in court Tuesday for an initial appearance. A removal hearing will also be held to send him back to New York where the charges he faces were originally filed.
