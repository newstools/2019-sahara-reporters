Kano State governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, has issued Emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi II, a two-day ultimatum to either accept or reject his appointment as head of the state’s council of chiefs. Contained in a letter dated December 19, the directive was signed by Musa Bichi, Permanent Secretary, Special Duties, on behalf of the Secretary to the State Government. Recall that Governor Ganduje had on December 9 appointed Sanusi as head of the council of chiefs following his assent to a law that created other emirates, whittling the Emir of Kano’s powers.
