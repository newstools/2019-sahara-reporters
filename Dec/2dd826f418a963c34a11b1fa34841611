Commissioner of Police in the state, John Abang, disclosed this while speaking with journalists in Awka, the capital, on Tuesday. He said, “I’ll like Nigerians to know that Barrister Ifeanyi Ejiofor (a member of the proscribed IPOB) has been declared wanted. “I’ll seek the cooperation of law abiding Nigerians, East, West, North and South that wherever they find this individual, they should report to the nearest police station for possible arrest and prosecution based on the rules and laws of Nigeria.”
