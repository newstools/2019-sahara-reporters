 The Academic Staff Union of Universities has warned that the Integrated Payroll and Personal Information System will erode the powers of university governing councils. Chairman of ASUU, Modibbo Adama University of Technology, Yola, Dr Sadiq Umar, told journalists on Saturday that IPPIS must be stopped. He said, "Besides undermining the role of university governing councils, IPPIS automatically makes the Accountant-General of the Federation the governing council of all universities. “This chapter of ASUU strongly condemns the move. “The Accountant-General of the Federation implementing IPPIS would disrupt university hierarchy and system. “Let the governing council oversee the management of funds, promotion and employment of staff in the university." Umar further urged Nigerians to unite against IPPIS, arguing that it will disrupt the university system in the country.
