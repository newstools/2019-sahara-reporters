Civil Society Organisations and human rights activists on Monday converged on the Embassies of United States of America and United Kingdom in Abuja to demand visa ban to be placed on Director-General of the Department of State Services, Yusuf Bichi, and Attorney-General of Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN).Addressing journalists on behalf of the group, Adebayo Raphael said Bichi and Malami had continued to disobey court orders on Omoyele Sowore and also desecrated the sanctity of the court by sending DSS Operatives to invade the Federal High Court, Abuja, last Friday. Raphael said the ban was imperative at the moment on the two government officials for undermining Nigeria’s democracy.Raphael said,  "We believe that the United States can still do more considering its strategic role in Nigeria’s democracy to ensure that democracy is not undermined in Nigeria by anti-democratic and fascistic elements within the country. "We, therefore request in the best interest of Nigeria’s Democracy, that a visa ban be imposed on the Director-General of the Department of State Services, Yusuf Bichi, and his immediate family for undermining Nigeria’s democracy. " We also request that a visa ban be imposed on the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice in Nigeria, Abubakar Malami, and his immediate family considering his eerily suspicious silence in the face of the desecration of rule of law and violation of human rights by the DSS in Nigeria." The CSOs also asked the countries to impose as many other sanctions as deemed necessary on Nigeria to demonstrate its commitment to rule of law and human rights in the nation.
