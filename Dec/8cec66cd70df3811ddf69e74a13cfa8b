The Magistrate Court sitting in Akure, Ondo State, has ordered the remand in prison custody of Idowu Omosuyi, the policeman, who shot dead a truck driver. Omosuyi, 37, was docked at the Magistrate Court by the police on Monday. SaharaReporters gathered that offence of the policeman was contrary to section 316 and punishable under section 319 of criminal laws of the Ondo State. Goodluck Uloh, prosecutor in the case, accused Omosuyi of committing the offence at about 2:00pm along Uso-Owo Road while on official duty. Uloh however, sought for a motion on notice to remand of the policeman at a correctional centre in order to gather more evidence against him. But counsel to Omosuyi, Ikujuni Ademola, prayed the Magistrate Court to remand the defendant in police custody instead of prison. In her ruling, Magistrate Charity Adeyanju immediately ordered that Omosuyi be remanded at the Nigeria Correctional Service in Olokuta, Akure, Ondo State. She adjourned the matter until December 27, 2019 for further hearing. On December 2, the policeman pulled his trigger and killed the truck driver, Adeh Saleh, over the victimâ€™s refusal to offer a bribe.
