  President of Women Arise, Joe Okei-Odumakin, has condemned the rearrest of pro-democracy campaigner and Publisher of SaharaReporters, Omoyele Sowore, challenging President Muhammadu Buhari to prove to the world that he indeed does not have a hand in the matter. Sowore was rearrested in court on Friday morning by DSS operatives while standing trial in the case brought against him by the Nigerian Government. This came barely 24 hours after he was released on bail by the secret police. However, on Friday morning, heavily-armed DSS operatives stormed the courtroom where his trial was taking place, chased away the judge and disrupted the entire proceedings. The activist was physically assaulted by personnel of the agency, who in the process of trying to forcefully take him away tried to strangle him. Reacting to the development, Okei-Odumakin in a statement, described the invasion of the courtroom by armed security personnel as “barbaric”. She went on to condemn the agency’s disregard for rule of law and the constitution of Nigeria. She said, “The gangsteric conduct of the men said to be DSS operatives which led to the chasing away of the presiding judge, harassment of lawyers and journalists and manhandling of Sowore, was a crude assault on the hallowed seat of justice and further desecration of our judiciary. “The only way the government can attempt to prove it does not sanction this bestial conduct is to fish out those responsible for this barbaric conduct and ensure that the rule of law is followed in the case of Sowore.”
