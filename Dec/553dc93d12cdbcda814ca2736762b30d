  The All Progressives Congress in Rivers State has been cleared to conduct its ward, local government and state congresses in the state. This follows a High Court sitting in Port Harcourt order, which threw out the originating summons brought by one Ibrahim Umar and 22 others against the party. Also setting aside an interim injunction obtained by the claimants on September 14, 2019, which stopped the APC from conducting the congresses in Rivers State scheduled for September 17, 18 and 21, the presiding judge, Justice G.O Ollor, ruled that the court lacked the power to enforce and interpret the judgment of the court of coordinate jurisdiction. Justice Ollor also ruled that the interim order of injunction obtained by Ibrahim Umar and others was gotten without jurisdiction of the court and thereby set aside the order and thereafter awarded N100,000 as cost in favour of the APC. Describing the judgment as the beauty of justice, counsel to the claimants, Henry Bello, vowed to appeal the judgment based on the instruction of his clients. One of the counsels to APC, Jerome Williams, described the judgment as a landmark, which has given the party the opportunity to go ahead to conduct its congresses in Rivers State.
