According to a report by The Nation, Chairman of  Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission, Elias Mbam, said the sum was recovered following an audit on these agencies. He said, "The commission has carried out reconciliation and verification of revenue collections from revenue collecting agencies on behalf of the Federal Inland Revenue Services and Nigerian Custom Service. Over N75bn has been recovered in this process. The commission shall intensify its efforts in this regard.
