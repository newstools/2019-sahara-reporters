  The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has arraigned one Modesta Edeh over alleged N119,000 fraud. Edeh was arraigned before Justice Mobolaji Olajuwon of the Federal High Court sitting in Makurdi, Benue State. She was arraigned on a one count charge bordering on obtaining money by false pretence to the tune of N119,000.00 (One hundred and nineteen thousand naira only). Trouble started for Edeh when the EFCC received a petition from one of her victims, who alleged that she claimed to be collaborating with Gold Club Investment Scheme, a purported affiliate of Gold Coin Community Help. She further claimed that the scheme invests depositorsâ€™ funds, giving them mouth-watering returns after five months. The petitioner alleged that an enrollment fee of N41,000 was paid for registration, N39,000 for enrollment into the $100 category, and N39,000 as a re-commitment fee, totalling N119,000. However, the commission said five months after, the expected profit on investment was not forthcoming, neither was there a refund of the deposited funds. All efforts made to recover the funds also proved abortive.
