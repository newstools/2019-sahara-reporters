IGP Mohammed Adamu The Abuja Division of the Federal High Court upheld the power of the Nigeria Police ForceÂ and the Police Council under the control of the Inspector-General of Police to recruit constables into the force. The court dismissed the suit filed by the Police Service Commission against the IGP, Mohammed Adamu. Justice Inyang Ekwo in his judgment said that Adamu could now carry on with the recruitment of 10,000 police constables. The PSC had approached the court seeking a pronouncement that it was the statutory body charged with the enlistment of rank and file also known as constable recruitment into the Nigeria Police Force. Justice Ekwo held that by the provision of Section 71 of the Police Act, it was the Nigeria Police Council under the leadership of the IGP that was empowered with the enlistment of rank and file into the force. According to the judge, there was nothing in the documentary evidence placed before the court by the PSC to support its claims that the IGP had usurped the powers of the commission in the enlistment of rank and file into the Nigerian Police. In the suit, the PSC asked the court to stop the ongoing recruitment exercise of 10,000 constables by the NPF. The court however, insisted that the Police Council under the control of the IGP was the statutory body to carry out such an exercise.
