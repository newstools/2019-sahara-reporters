Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky
Islamic Movement of Nigeria Mohammed, son of detained leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, has expressed concern over the deteriorating health of his father, Ibraheem El-Zakzaky. A high court in Kaduna had on Friday ordered the Department of State Services to transfer El-Zakzaky and his wife, Zeenat, to take them to the Nigerian Correctional Centre in the state to allow his lawyerâ€™s easy access to him. In a statement on Tuesday, Mohammed said the movement of his father and mother to a correctional facility in Kaduna posed a grave risk to their health and life. He lamented the poor and dilapidated condition at correctional center, which he said was capable of worsening the health condition of his parents. Mohammed said, "It is well known that conditions in jail are so bad that they take a heavy toll on healthy prisoners, let alone those suffering from serious health problems. "I am writing to protest in the strongest possible terms about the continued mistreatment of my father, Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky and mother, Zeenah, at the hands of the Nigerian authorities. "My mother is also seriously ill and can barely walk. She also has a bullet trapped near her spine." Mohammed reminded the Nigerian authorities that his father had lost his sight as a result of gunshots during the Zaria massacre in December 2015. He said the security operatives had refused to allow him have access to his parents in custody on many occasions. The IMN leader and his wife are standing trial over allegations of culpable homicide, unlawful assembly and disruption of public peace, among other charges, in another court.
