  The Nigerian Air Force said it has launched operation ‘Rattle Snake’ in its bid to continue neutralising Boko Haram insurgents. NAF Director of Public Relations and Information, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, made this known in a statement on Wednesday. Daramola noted that the operation was already yielding the intended outcome. He said, “On day one of the operations, airstrikes by NAF aircraft resulted in the neutralisation of several Boko Haram terrorists and destruction of some of their structures at their tactical headquarters in Parisu as well as another settlement, Garin Maloma, both on the fringes of the Sambisa Forest in Borno State.” According to the News Agency of Nigeria, the attacks were executed following series of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance missions that showed the presence of a significant number of insurgents in makeshift structures/buildings under trees spread across the two settlements. Daramola added, “Overhead Parisu, no fewer than 30 terrorists were observed by the ISR aircraft in different parts of the settlement. “The attack aircraft dispatched by the ATF to engage the location recorded accurate hits within the target area, leading to the destruction of some of the structures as well as the killing of several terrorists.”
