   Courts in Cross River State have made known their intention to start vetting journalists before they are allowed to cover and report any judicial proceedings. This was revealed by Justice Simon Amobeda on Monday during the trial of detained journalist, Agba Jalingo. The judge had earlier detained two photojournalists, Mr Leo Ashiebe and Mr Patrick Obia, in his office for taking pictures of the court premises. A journalist, who witnessed the scenario and pleaded anonymity, said, “They met with Justice Simon Amobeda who asked them to introduce themselves. “He made Leo Ashiebe who was standing in for Williams Udida to contact Williams. “He said he could get them arrested if they could not identify themselves properly. “He then called the Registrar to take them to his office and wrote their names, addresses and telephone numbers. “The judge announced that starting from January 2020, nobody would be allowed to come into the court with phone, stating that the era of reporting court proceeding without clearance was over.”
