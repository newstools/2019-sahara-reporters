  Persons with disabilities in Lagos State has urged Governor Babjide Sanwo-Olu to revive and ensure the full implementation of the Lagos State Special People’s Law. The group, in a statement to mark the 2019 International Day of Persons with Disabilities jointly signed by Dr Adebukola Adebayo, Chairman of PWD in Lagos, and Adewale Adeyanju, Public Relation Officer, noted that the Special People’s Law endorsed by the Ministry of Education in 2015 had been virtually abandoned and unimplemented. The group posited that while the law had helped to improve inclusion and access to persons with disabilities in some critical sectors including education through the nearly 50 inclusive and special primary and secondary schools; the attainment of a disability-inclusive Lagos State is still very far-fetched. The community of PWDs in Lagos also said that it was poised towards consolidating on the gains from the nearly one decade of implementing the Lagos State Special People’s Law The group said, “As at today— hundreds of thousands of children with disabilities in Lagos are still unable to go to school because the Inclusive Education Policy of the state government endorsed by the Ministry of Education in 2015 had been virtually abandoned and unimplemented. “Inclusive public primary and secondary schools are not enough, not adequately staffed and poorly equipped, and lack capacity to practice real and proper inclusive education. "All public hospitals are not accessible to PWDs especially our women with disabilities; hence, the high prevalence of maternal and infant mortality among women and children with disabilities. “There are no sign language interpreters for deaf persons while many health facilities are located in buildings that are not physically accessible to the wheelchair users and the blind. "Public hospitals lack social workers and care-givers that can give support to PWDs whenever they need health services.” The group urged the governor to “within the next six months mandate critical sectors in the state to review or develop their policy frameworks to ensure that their services were inclusive and accessible for PWDs.
