The state Head of Service, Mr Dare Aragbaiye, confirmed this in Akure, the state capital, on Monday during the 2019 Public Service Week anniversary. Aragbaiye explained that the 51 workers failed to showed up for the screening exercise and since then, they have not returned to work. He said, “Since they did not show up for the screening, that means they are ghost workers and for that reason, their salaries have been stopped and their names have been removed from the government’s payroll. “Even if they show up today, they have some questions to answer.”
