 A traditional ruler, Henry Ukenukpepia, Etuwede III, of Uzere community, Isoko South Local Government Area of Delta State, has been accused of duping his kinsman, Godwin Emonena, of N25m through a non-existent Niger Delta Development Commission contract. SaharaReporters reliably gathered that the monarch had allegedly defrauded Emonena with the promising of helping him secure the contract for the construction of Owhaha-Okwagbe-Otutuama Road in Ughelli South Local Government Area of the state. The contract award letter dated September 15, 2017 and signed by Adjogbe Samuel, then Executive Director of Projects of the NDDC, put the contract sum at N249.6m. In a petition dated September 6, 2019 signed by S.O Oboro of Comfort Chambers on behalf of Emonena and addressed to the Area Commander of police in Ozoro, ACP. C. Emeodi, the monarch was accused of fraud, false pretence and criminal conducts among others. The petition called for the intervention and investigation of the matter and recovery of the said N25m. Following the petition, the police swung into action and arrested the monarch and an undertaking and affidavit from the Ozoro High Court in support of the undertaking was entered on September 20, 2019 by the suspect before the Area Commander and victim including other witnesses. However, our correspondent reliably gathered that on the said date the monarch promised to pay back the N25m, he defaulted and instead sued the complainant, Emonena, Area Command and others over what he claimed was a breach of his fundamental human rights. When contacted on the issue, the traditional ruler denied collecting money from Emonena, adding that, "I am not a contractor, so I couldn't have secured any contract for anybody. “Meanwhile, I won't talk more than this because the matter is already in court.”
