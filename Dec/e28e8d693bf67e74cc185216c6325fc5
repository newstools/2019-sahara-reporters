 A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has directed the Attorney-General the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), Director-General of the Department of State Services, Yusuf Bichi, to appear before it on December 23, 2019 over the rearrest and unlawful detention of pro-democracy campaigner and journalist, Omoyele Sowore. Justice I.E Ekwo gave the order on Tuesday following a bench ruling ordering Malami and Bichi to appear before the court on the set date. Ekwo said though he would be proceeding on vacation, another judge would continue with the case. Sowore through one of his lawyers, Abubakar Marshal, had filed a suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/1409/2019 before the court challenging his rearrest by the secret police. When the matter came up for hearing, Marshal asked the court to order the release of Sowore but was turned down by the judge. The judge said he was aware of the processes filed and he therefore adjourned the case. Few days after the Malami gave an order to the DSS to hands off Sowore's case and forward the file to his office, the AGF claimed that he cannot order the release of the journalist from DSS detention. Sowore was rearrested on December 6 by the DSS at the Federal High Court, Abuja, barely 24-hours after he was released on bail. The 48-year-old is yet to be told the reason for his rearrest.
