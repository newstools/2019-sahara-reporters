 Members of the Joint National Association of Persons With Disabilities on Monday staged a peaceful protest in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, to register their displeasure over poor welfare in the society in commemoration of the International Day for Persons With Disabilities. The protest led to gridlock in parts of the city as many shops and business centres wereÂ  shut down. Eric Ikilowei, Acting Chairman of the association in Bayelsa State, said they had no choice than to stage the protest to register their anger. He said, "The protest became necessary being the only option left since the state government had refused to respond to our demand for funds to enable us join other persons with disabilities across the world to commemorate their day."
