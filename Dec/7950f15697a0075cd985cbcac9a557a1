Former National Security Adviser, Col. Sambo Dasuki (rtd)
Sahara Reporters Media The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has made the move to separate Sambo Dasuki, a former National Security Adviser, for his trial with his co-defendants. Rotimi Jacobs (SAN), lawyer to EFCC, made the application on Wednesday at the Federal High Court in Abuja. Jacobs said the separation becomes necessary to expedite the trial of other defendants that have been stalled since Dasuki refused to be present in court. The commission is trying Dasuki and others on two separate charges bordering on money laundering and fraud. In one case, EFCC is prosecuting Dasuki alongside a former Minister of State for Finance, Bashir Yuguda; a former Sokoto State governor, Attahiru Bafarawa; his son, Sagir, and his company, Dalhatu Investment Limited. In another, the former NSA boss is answering charges with a former General Manager in the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Aminu Baba-Kusa, and two firms: Acacia Holdings Limited and Reliance Referral Hospital Limited. However, the embattled politician said he would not appear in court for his trial expect the Nigerian Government compiles with multiple court orders for his release. The EFCC has now been frustrated by this protest. Jacobs said the case has been in the same place for four years. “We can’t be in the same place for four years without moving,” he said.
