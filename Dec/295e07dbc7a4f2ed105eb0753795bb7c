  The Niger State Government has warned members of the National Youth Service Corps posted to the state to avoid some local government areas in the state because of high risk of violence. Secretary to the state government, Ahmed Matane, said this during the swearing-in of corps members posted to Niger. He assured corps members of the state government’s commitment to ensure their safety. He said, “We will ensure that no corps member is posted to areas in the four local governments with security challenges.” There have been bandit attacks in Rafi, Shiroro, Munya and parts of Mashegu Local Government Areas of the state in recent times. Matane said corps members would only be posted to trouble-prone areas if the menace was tackled, while commending security agencies for the relative peace enjoyed in the state. He said that the ongoing development of camp facilities was to give comfort to corps members and assured of government’s continuous support.
