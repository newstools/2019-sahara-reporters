  Documents seen by PUNCH have indicated that ex-Federal Inland Revenue Service boss, Babatunde Fowler, tried in vain to hold on to his job despite the expiration of his tenure. In a letter dated December 9, 2019, Fowler wrote to the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, reminding him that his tenure was approaching expiration. Fowler had in the letter said, “In view of the above, I wish to present myself for re-appointment for a second term. "This is consistent with provisions of the FIRS Establishment Act 2007 and would grant me the opportunity to consolidate and build on the achievements we have recorded in the past four years. “Please find attached the highlight of my achievements during my first tenure in office. "I would like to put on record my gratitude to Mr President for the opportunity to serve the nation. "I am also thankful for your support in the course of the discharge of my duties.” Fowler was also said to have lobbied fruitlessly to regain his office. Chief of Staff to President Muhamadu Buhari, Abba Kyari, had earlier in the year asked Fowler to explain why he could not meet the government’s target of N9trn. Fowler blamed the situation on recession at the time and the performance of the economy. On Monday, Buhari named Muhammad Nami as new head of the FIRS.
