 Idowu Omosuyi, the police officer thatÂ killed a truck driver along the Akure-Owo Expressroad, Ondo State has finally surrendered himself to the police authorities. Sergeant Omosuyi showed up at the Ondo Police Command headquarters on Thursday, barely twenty-four hours after he was declared wanted by the police authorities. Omosuyi, who is attached to the Federal Highway Patrol, had on Monday shot Ado Saleh on the head at a security check point after the latter refused to pay him a bribe. Saleh died on the spot. Several residents who spoke to SaharaReporters had earlier accused the state police command of trying to shield the erring policemen. The Police Spokesman in Ondo state, Femi Joseph, who confirmed his appearance at the police headquarters said that the police officers would face a disciplinary panel. Joseph explained that the Ondo State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Udie Adie, had already set up a panel to investigate and also prosecute the erring officer. "The officer (Sergeant Omoniyi) would now have to face a panel of investigation that was set up by the Commissioner of Police on the case. "We have repeatedly said that the case would not be swept under the carpet and just as we have assured members of the public that the Nigeria police shall continue to abide by the laws and protect the lives and properties of the people," he said.
