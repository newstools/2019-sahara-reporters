 A group of women on Thursday protested in front of the Federal High Court in Abuja to demand the immediate release of Omoyele Sowore and Olawale Bakare. To drive home their demand, the elderly women removed their blouses, revealing only their bras. According to the women, Sowore their son, had not committed any crime therefore President Muhammadu Buhari should order his immediate and unconditional release from the detention of Department of State Services.
