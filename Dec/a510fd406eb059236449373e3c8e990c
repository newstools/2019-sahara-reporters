  A group of women on Wednesday in Abuja took to the streets to protest the killing of the slain leader of the Peoples Democratic Party in Kogi State, Salome Abuh. Abuh was brutally killed by suspected political thugs during the recent governorship election in Kogi. The protesters, who converged at the National Human Rights Commission, demanded justice and speedy investigation into the immediate and remote cause of the incident. The women condemned the poor handling of the investigation into the killing by the government. They called on the police to expedite action and bring the perpetrators to book. Executive Secretary of the NHRC, Tony Ojukwu, who received the protesters, promised to liaise with appropriate authorities on the matter. He assured the protesting women of speedy action and justice on the matter.
