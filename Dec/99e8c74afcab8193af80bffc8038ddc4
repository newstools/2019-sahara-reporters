File Photo: Ifeanyi Ejiofor addressing IPOB members  Ifeanyi Ejiofor, lawyer to leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, who was declared wanted by the Nigerian Police after his house was set ablaze, has dragged the police to court over the incident. A clash in his home in Orafite, Ekwusigo Local Government Area of Anambra State, on December 2, 2019 led to the killing of three of his kinsmen and two policemen. Ejiofor is asking a court to declare as illegal the move by the police declaring him wanted, stating that the police did not give him adequate time, opportunity and facilities to appear and respond to a complaint before the invasion of his home. He is also asking the court to grant an order restraining the respondents, their agents, privies and howsoever called from further harassing, intimidating, threatening the life of the applicant and destroying the house and properties. He is also asking for an order “directing the respondents to forthwith retract the publication/notice made to the public on December 3, 2019 declaring the applicant wanted. “Compensatory and general damages in the sum of N2,000,000,000.00 (Two Billion Naira Only), against the police." He is further asking for an unreserved public apology to the applicant in five national dailies and any other form of reparation that the court may deem fit to grant.
