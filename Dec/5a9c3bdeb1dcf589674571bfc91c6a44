 A former Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice of Edo State, Osagie Obayuwana, has called for the dissolution of the Department of State Services. The former commissioner, while speaking at the 2019 World Human Rights Week organised by the Edo Civil Society Organisations in Benin, said the law creating the secret police should be repealed. He also condemned the rearrest of pro-democracy campaigner and journalist, Omoyele Sowore, within the premises of the Federal High Court in Abuja on Friday. Operatives of the DSS had besieged the court on Friday to effect a rearrest barely 24 hours after it released Sowore on bail after 125 in detention. Obayuwana called on Nigerians and the Nigerian Bar Association to insist that the National Assembly repeal the law that established the DSS and lay the foundation for a new security agency that is focused on the protection of the wellbeing of all Nigerians.
