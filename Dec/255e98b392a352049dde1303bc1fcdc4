   Former President of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan, has criticised the country's political system, saying “something is fundamentally wrong”. Jonathan said this while condemning the killing and violence that trailed the governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states. He urged politicians to desist from employing violent means to gain power. He said, “Let me plead with my fellow politicians, they should stop killing people, destroying properties because people want to own office. “What happened in the last governorship elections in my state Bayelsa, and Kogi State especially in Kogi where a woman was burnt alive in her house, is something that should not happen in any normal society. Something is fundamentally wrong with our political system. “Only on Friday in one African country, we were discussing the politics of our continent…most of us former Heads of State, Presidents, and Vice Presidents. "The way African politics is going, we are replacing military coup with civilian coup and that cannot sustain the continent."
