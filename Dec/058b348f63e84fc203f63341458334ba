 Kano State governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, has begun the process of creating four new emirates in the state. The governor sent the notice to the state House of Assembly in a new bill forwarded on Monday. In a statement by the state’s Commissioner for Information, Muhammad Garba, the executive had approved of the bill which had been transmitted to the legislators for deliberation. The statement reads, “To this end, the Council has, with this development, endorsed the establishment of four new emirates namely Rano, Gaya, Bichi and Karaye and forwarded same to the state House of Assembly for necessary action. “Some of these emirates have even pre-dated Kano in ancient times, while the effort to revive them during the Second Republic was short-lived. “Council seriously discussed the decade long clamour for the establishment of additional emirates in the state with a view to bringing more development to the people of the new emirates. "The exercise was also informed by the need to bring traditional institution closer to the people in addition to facilitating speedy socio-economic development and security in the state." Governor Ganduje has been in disagreement with the Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi, who is considered a fierce critic of his administration. It is believed that the need to create new emirates in the state was geared towards breaking the powers of Sanusi. A few days ago, a high court sacked the recently created emirates and emirs. The court said the Kano House of Assembly did not follow due process in creating the new emirates.
