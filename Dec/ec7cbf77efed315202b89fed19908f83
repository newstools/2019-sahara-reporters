 Some gunmen, who seized a Catholic priest in Delta State, Samuel Agwameseh, has established contact with his family and demanded N20m as ransom to free him. The priest was kidnapped over the weekend, SaharaReporters learnt. Confirming the latest development, Director of Social Communication, Catholic Diocese of Issele-Uku, Delta State, Charles Uganwa, said the kidnappers are yet to lower their demand. He said, "The Catholic church does not pay ransom for abducted priests. "We are pleading with the kidnappers to unconditionally free the priest. "The church don't have money and the same time we don't involve in ransom payment to kidnappers." A priest in the Diocese of Issele-Uku, who asked not to be named, told our correspondent that the kidnappers have threatened to kill the victim if the N20m was not paid. Calls to the spokesperson for the police in the state, Onome Onowakpoyeya, were not answered when our correspondent sought confirmation.
