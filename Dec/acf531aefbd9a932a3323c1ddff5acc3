There is growing fear among supporters and family members over the state of health of pro-democracy campaigner and journalist, Omoyele Sowore, after the 48-year-old activist was struck by an unidentified man in court in Abuja on Friday morning. Sowore had arrived early to stand trial in the case brought against him by the Nigerian Government accusing him of insulting President Muhammadu Buhari and planning to bring down his regime.  Midway through at the Federal High Court, heavily-armed operatives of the Department of State Services abruptly disrupted the proceedings, forcing presiding judge, Ijeoma Ojukwu, to run for safety.  Sowore was attacked and flung to the ground, where the yet-to-be-identified man, dressed in a lawyer’s robes but suspected to be a DSS agent, reached down and hit him in the neck with something. Upon noticing that he had been hit with something strange in the neck, the videos show Sowore turning around swiftly to query why the strange man was hitting him.  “Why did you hit me? What did you hit me with?” Sowore asked, before adding, “Who is this guy?” In various video footages of the chaos in the courtroom analysed by SaharaReporters, the tall man is seen holding and trying to pull Sowore to the ground from the chair he was seated.
