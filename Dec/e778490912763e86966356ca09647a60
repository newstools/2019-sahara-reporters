  The Nigerian Government has said there is no date in sight for the re-opening of Nigeria's land borders. The government shut the border to curb smuggling. Neighbouring countries have raised the alarm over the closure but the Nigerian Government has insisted that the border would remain closed until there was a commitment from neighbouring countries to curb smuggling. President Muhammadu Buhari, who said this on Monday in Daura, Katsina State, also stated that he had not given any date for the reopening of the land borders. He disclosed that the countryâ€™s domestic fuel consumption had dropped by more than 30 per cent following the closure of land borders. Buhari, while speaking, hailed the actions taken by the President of Niger Republic, Muhammadou Youssoufou, including the dismissal of officials and a ban on the use of the country as dumping ground for Nigeria-bound smuggled goods.
