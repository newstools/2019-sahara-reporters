CNN  At least 11 persons have been wounded in a shooting in New Orleans’ French Quarter on Sunday morning, according to a report by AFP. The police further disclosed that two of the victims were in a critical condition. The shooting took place at 3:00am on a crowded commercial street near many hotels in a historic district that attracts visitors from around the world. No fatalities had been reported and police said they quickly responded to the incident as extra patrols were on duty for an annual Thanksgiving weekend university football game in the city. “We had officers on that very block that thought they were being fired upon,” police superintendent Shaun Ferguson told reporters. “Unfortunately, there were so many people out here we were unable to determine who was actually firing shots at the time. We do not know how it started.”
