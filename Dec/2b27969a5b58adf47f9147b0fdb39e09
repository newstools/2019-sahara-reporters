English Premier League side, Everton, have finally sacked manager, Marco Silva, after 18 months, which brought some of the worst results for the club. The management of the club took the decision to relief Silva of his job after they were pummelled by city rivals – Liverpool – on Wednesday 5-2, leaving them languishing in the relegation zone on the league table. Silva won 24 and lost 24 of his 60 games after taking charge of the team in May 2018. Everton are now searching for their fourth permanent boss since Roberto Martinez was sacked in May 2016. Former manager, David Moyes, has been considered as a potential interim successor, but the suggestion has sparked a largely negative reaction from supporters.
