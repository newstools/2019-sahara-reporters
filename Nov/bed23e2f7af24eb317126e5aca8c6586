  Farooq Kperogi, a Nigerian professor based in the United States,claims he has received at least a threat from a member of PresidentMuhammadu Buhari's family, Bello Inua Anka.Kperogi said he was being threatened for posting on Twitter a birthdayvideo of Mamman Daura, Buhari's nephew and chief of staff.In a screenshot of the conversation, Kperogi pointed out that whathappened between him and Anka, the sender threatened to sue theprofessor and critic of the Buhari regime if he failed to pull downthe video."I promise you won't get away with this. You will hear from my lawyersas long as the video remains on your wall," the message said.Kperogi, who was accused of sharing various unfounded pictures andvideos during the 2019 elections, said he merely shared the video thatwas already in the public domain.He said: "I didn’t shoot the video. It isn’t exclusive to me. In fact,it had already done the social media rounds before I shared it on mysocial media handles."The video was shot, edited, and shared by a member of the Buharifamily. Why should I edit or take it down?"Continuing, Kperogi stated, "Anyway, if his threat is limited to suingme in US courts where I live and work, I’m waiting for him. I’vealready notified my lawyers here. But there’s something darker andmore sinister in the threat 'I promise you won’t get away with this'."I’ve received countless threats from supporters of Buhari’s fascistmonocracy. Someone even called for my execution—along with ChidiOdinkalu and Ahmed Salkida— on Twitter last week."I dismissed it as the inconsequential overzealousness of a facelessBuhari Media Center (BMC) troll."
