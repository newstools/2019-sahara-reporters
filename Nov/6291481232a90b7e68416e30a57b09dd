  Governors of Ekiti and Sokoto states, Kayode Fayemi and Aminu Tambuwal, have been selected to speak on 20 years of democracy in Nigeria at a conference in Oxford University, United Kingdom. The governors are expected to reflect on Nigeria’s Fourth Republic in their addresses to the international audience, which will be hosted by the African Studies Centre of the university. Convener of the conference, Prof Wale Adebanwi, who is the Director of Oxford African Studies Centre and Rhodes Professor of Race Relations, said that the structural errors of the state and the fundamental contradictions of the society that democratic governance was expected to confront or manage have deepened. He said, “The hopes invested in the country’s return to democratic rule in 1999 seem to be flagging as Nigeria is confronted with a myriad of political, economic and social crises. “Yet, given her historical experiences, there is no better alternative to democratic governance in Nigeria. "In light of this, the participants at the conference will explore the political, economic and social forces, processes, and challenges which have shaped Nigeria in the Fourth Republic.” Renowned American scholar of democracy and author, Prof Larry Diamond, will give the keynote address at the conference where many scholars based in Nigeria, Europe and the United States will present papers. Several others notable personalities are also expected to speak at the event.
