  A policeman in Imo State, Paul Joseph, on Wednesday reportedly committed suicide over alleged delayed promotion, a report by PUNCH said. It was said that Joseph, who hailed from Taraba State, was long overdue for promotion to the rank of Inspector but had yet to be promoted by the Police Service Commission. A source at the bank he was attached said, “While staff were resuming for work for the day, they heard gunshot at the security house at the gate. “Upon enquiry, they discovered that the policeman had killed himself.” Joseph is said to have been venting his anger over the alleged refusal of the police authorities to promote him to the rank of an Inspector. When contacted, the spokesperson for the police in Imo, Orlando Ikeokwu, confirmed the incident and said the deceased’s corpse had been deposited at a morgue.
