Emmanuel Udom  The Court of Appeal sitting in Calabar, Cross River State, has dismissed the appeal filed by Nsima Ekere of the All Progressives Congress challenging the victory of Emmanuel Udom in the 2019 governorship election. The appellate court also confirmed the ruling of the governorship tribunal by affirming Udom as governor of the state. The Court of Appeal held that the tribunal was right to have dismissed the petition filed by the APC on the basis that no credible evidence was provided against challenging Udomâ€™s victory. Delivering the ruling, a five-man panel held that out of the results of 21 local government areas challenged, the petitioner did not provide any evidence in proving their case in eight. The court also awarded the cost of N500,000 in favour of the first respondent to be paid by the appellants.
