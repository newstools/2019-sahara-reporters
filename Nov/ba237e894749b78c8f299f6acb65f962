 Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammad Sa'ad Abubakar, has banned planned protest on gender-based violence in the state.The ban is targeted at a rights group, #ArewaMeToo movement, seeking justice for victims of abuse in Northern Nigeria as well as creating awareness about gender-based violence.Reacting to the activities of the movement inspired by America's #MeToo movement, the Sokoto Sultanate Council in a post on Facebook said, "The ArewaMeToo movement and any of its affiliated activities are hereby banned in Sokoto State till further notice."However, rights activists have described the directive by the Sultan as "archaic", "patriarchal", "backward" and inconsistent with modern day realities.Leader of the #ArewaMeToo movement, Sadiya Taheer, was reportedly assaulted by the police on orders of men, who accused the group of spreading LGBTQ ideas in Sokoto State.
