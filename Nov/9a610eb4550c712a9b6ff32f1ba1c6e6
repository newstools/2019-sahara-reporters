Borno State governor, Babagana Zulum, on Tuesday gave a December 31 ultimatum to members of the Maiduguri GSM Market to relocate to New Bulunkutu GSM Market or risk having their shops demolished. Recall that the Maiduguri GSM Market was gutted by fire on October 31, 2019, leaving over 47 shops and property worth millions of naira destroyed. Zulum gave the ultimatum when the traders paid him a visit at the Government House in Maiduguri, the state capital, on Tuesday. He said, “I give you till December 31, 2019 to relocate from GSM Market to New Market in Bulunkutu or risk your shops being demolished.” Zulum said the move was to decongest the area to allow free flow of traffic and movement.”
