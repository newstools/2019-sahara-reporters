Adamawa State governor, Ahmadu Fintiri, has ordered the immediate sack of all permanent secretaries not on Grade Level 17 before appointment. The state's civil service rule stipulates the procedure for Permanent Secretaries, pegging the qualification at Grade Level 17. Fintiri gave the directive on Wednesday in Yola, the state capital, while receiving the final report of the Technical Committee for the Evaluation of Civil Service. He also hinted that his administration will gradually phase out the office of the Deputy Permanent Secretary in the state as it was not enshrined in the scheme of civil service. A review committee, had observed that procedure for appointing Permanent Secretaries was floutedÂ  under previous administrations.
