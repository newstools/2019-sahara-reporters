The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria has urged the European Union and the United States Government to impose sanctions on President Muhammadu Buhari, who they described as an “autocratic” leader. The group, which made the call in a statement, condemned the non-release of pro-democracy advocate, Omoyele Sowore, who has been in detention for over 100 days despite a court order directing the Department of State Services to release him. HURIWA said, “We condemn the failure of the Department of State Services to release the duo of Omoyele Sowore and Olawale Bakare even after they met the stiff bail conditions slammed on them by the Federal High Court presided over by Ijeoma Ojukwu. “HURIWA is hereby urging the European Union and the United States Government to impose sanctions on the government of President Muhammadu Buhari, which has become autocratic and has serially disrespected binding decisions of the competent courts of law provided for in Section 6 of the constitution.” The group went on to condemn the Kano State Police Command for the extra judicial killing of a 26-year old man, Abdulkadir Nasir, who was handed over to the police voluntarily by his father – Nasiru Madobi.
