Jose Mourinho
Premier League  Portuguese Coach, Jose Mourinho, began his reign as head coach of English Premiership side Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday with a 3-2 win over fellow Londoners – West Ham United. Goals from Son Heung-min, Lucas Moura and Harry Kane ensured that Mourinho's team walked away with the three maximum points despite two late goals from West Ham through Michail Antonio and Angelo Ogbonna. The win ends a run of poor results for Spurs, who before this game sat in 14th position on the leagues table, forcing the management of the club to fire Mauricio Pochettino.
