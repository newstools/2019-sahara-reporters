Chief Executive Officer, Enyo Retail and Supply, Abayomi Awobokun, has said that the Nigerian Government has to become aggressive to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. According to Awobokun, the implementation of SDGs such as quality education, clean water and sanitation, will help to achieve overall development plans, reduce future economic, environmental and social costs, strengthen economic competitiveness and reduce poverty. He added that the country must examine how various sectors of the society, especially the private sector are translating this shared vision into national development plans and strategies. He said, “Nigeria needs to become aggressive in achieving the SDGs and adopting measures that will enable our nation leap forward. “There is the need to invest in education, health – through clean water, technology and security, through Public and Private Partnership as more efforts like this are required.” The Enyo CEO said the organisation is committed to ensuring that children in Nigeria are better equipped and qualified to compete in the global world by providing a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) café that caters to kids from age five to 12.
