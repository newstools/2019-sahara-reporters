The Nigerian Army has said that it needs the support of other security agencies in the country to effectively tackle insecurity in Nigeria. General Officer Commanding, 2 Division, Ibadan, Oyo State, Maj. Gen. Anthony Omozoje, said there was the need for security agencies to come together to tackle the problem. Omozoje spoke during a public lecture held in Okitipupa Local Council Area of Ondo State. He said, "It is quite clear that when we synergise, we deliver better on our various core responsibilities because we are all key players in the security spectrum. "When we properly synergise, we are better covering all spectrum of the country as it is our duty to protect the citizens even though each of us have a particular sector to take care of. "And this is why all security and paramilitary agencies need to join hands with the Nigerian Army in ensuring that all forms of criminality are curtailed in the country." Earlier in his lecture, Brig. Gen. Joseph Omolafe (retd), said there was the need for security agencies to shun rivalry in order to improve national security. He said, "The simple cause of rivalry between security agencies is lack of education and information that they are working towards the same goal. "So, we must build trust among ourselves, work as a team and see our roles as working towards national security."
