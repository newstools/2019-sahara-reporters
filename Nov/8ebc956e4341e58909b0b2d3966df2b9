The Nigerian Union of Journalists, FCT Council, has condemned the Department of State Services for assaulting journalists and destroying their gadgets during a protest calling for the release of Omoyele Sowore and Olawale Bakare in Abuja on Tuesday. The union warned that it was a dangerous time to be a journalist in Nigeria given the near-daily intimidation, harassment and detention of practitioners in the country. In a statement by Chairman of the council, Emmanuel Ogbeche, the NUJ described as unfortunate and deeply troubling the conduct of operatives of the DSS against journalists that had gone to cover a protest. The statement reads, “From reports and videos from our members who were on the ground to cover a sit-out at the SSS Headquarters in Abuja, it could be seen that they were harassed, intimidated, tear-gassed and even arrested and detained. This speaks to a more sinister and perilous time to be a journalist in Nigeria.

He urged journalists not to be intimidated by the DSS and government in trying to discharge their responsibilities to Nigerians.
