  The Peoples Democratic Party has said that it holds no ill feeling towards former President Goodluck Jonathan over his role in the just concluded Bayelsa governorship election. PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, disclosed this in an interview with journalists after a meeting of the party’s National Working Committee in Abuja. Reports had suggested that Jonathan might face internal party sanctions for what looked like his support for the candidate of the All Progressive Congress, who eventually emerged winner of the governorship elections. But debunking that notion, Ologbondiyan said, “The issue of former President Goodluck Jonathan did not come up at the meeting and it was not discussed. “You must know about the procedure and processes in our party. If we do not have a report or an issue before us, we cannot delve into. “As we speak now, we do not have any matter concerning Jonathan before us in the party.” Ologbondiyan said that the only issue discussed at the meeting was the November 16 election in Kogi and Bayelsa, of which the National Chairman, Mr Uche Secondus, would formally address the press on the party’s position on Thursday.
