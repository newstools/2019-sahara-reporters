  The Transmission Company of Nigeria on Thursday said the African Development Bank has approved a $200m loan for its transmission expansion project. This comes in addition to the $1.55bn secured from the World bank earlier. The Nigerian Government said it secured from the New York-based financier, as well as other fundings obtained from government. Ndidi Mbah, spokesperson for the organisation, said the AfDB board granted the loan on Wednesday at its Abidjan headquarters. She noted that the firm had already concluded environmental studies and the report had been submitted to the AfDB. She said the detail of the study includes a resettlement Action Plan, which will see persons affected by the acquisition of the Right of Way for the proposed transmission lines identified. Mbah notes that the TEP is part of a broader transmission, rehabilitation and expansion programme. The scheme hopes to reconstruct transmission lines across the North West, South South and South East. Beyond refurbishing old lines, the project will build new ones as well as construct new substations, contributing in order to increase its transmission capacity. TCN said it has an electricity wheeling capacity of 8,100 mw.
