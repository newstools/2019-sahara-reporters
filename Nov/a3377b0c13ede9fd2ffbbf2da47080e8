Late Mrs Esther Ejumejowo The Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria has issued a 30-day ultimatum to the management of Nisa Garki Hospital, Abuja, to answer to petitions and other allegations levelled against the hospital following the death of one Mrs Esther Ejumejowo.Her husband, a lawyer, Anthony, had in a petition by his counsel, Innocent Ukoha, addressed to the Minister of Health, Minister of Federal Capital Territory, and Chairman of MDCN, demanded an investigation into the cause of his wife's death. The lawyer alleged that there was a deliberate attempt to cover up the incident, which he claimed was caused by negligence on the part of the hospital's staff. Managing Director of the hospital, Adamu Onu, told SaharaReporters that they would prefer to wait for the MDCN's Verdict on the matter rather than make any comment. However, a senior official of the MDCN on Tuesday told SaharaReporters in confidence that letters had been sent to everyone mentioned in the petition and that action would soon commence. "The council has already written to the management of the hospital and everyone mentioned in the incident and a 30-day ultimatum has been given to them to respond to all petitions and allegations against them on the death of Mrs Ejumejowo," the official said. When contacted, Secretary of the MDCN,  E.D Abdu, told SaharaReporters that, "I am on leave now, I can't talk about the issue."
