The Edo State Deputy Governor, Philip Shaibu, has accused the NationalChairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, ofsetting him and Governor Godwin Obaseki up.In the last 48 hours, there have been accusation andcounter-accusation by both parties on who attacked who on Sundayduring convocation at Edo University. Iyamho.Oshiomhole had alleged that the deputy governor mobilized over 200commercial motorcycle riders (Okada riders) and thugs to the venue ofthe convocation to make a mockery of him.However, by his Chief Press Secretary, Musa Ebomhiana, the deputygovernor, on Monday denied having a hand in the alleged attack onOshiomhole.He said, "In fact, the deputy governor was himself a victim of theSaturday attack considering the fact that he was actually in the samebus with the governor, Oba of Lagos and other dignitaries"I see this as clearly a case of entrapment because the nationalchairman invited them to his house knowing very well that he hadprepared for them an attack by his political infantry as the statementdished out at the Sunday press conference did not add up."He then decided to teach the governor and his deputy a lesson byorganizing those misguided elements to take up arms against the state.He should be courageous enough to own up to his design."
