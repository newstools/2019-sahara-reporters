Addressing journalists on Wednesday in Abuja, the group expressed shock and dismay at the brazen display of impunity and terror unleashed on innocent protesters and journalists. Speaking on behalf of the group, Lanre Legacy said the coalition would not be deterred in its resolve to demand for the release of the detained activists. He said, “We will not give up the protest, we will continue until Sowore is released.”
