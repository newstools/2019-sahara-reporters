 Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, has said the National Assembly is likely to pass the budget next Wednesday. Lawan said this while entertaining representatives from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria. According to him, the presentation of the budget to a joint sitting of both legislative houses would have held on Tuesday but was postponed by a week. He said, “We want to pass the budget 2020 before the end of the year. “Today would have been the day for laying the budget but our committees on appropriations sought for an extension by one week only. “By Tuesday next week, we expect the budget 2020 to be laid before the two chambers of the National Assembly. “It is our desire to pass the budget the following day Wednesday.” Confirming Lawan’s submission, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, said during plenary on Tuesday that the committee on appropriation had asked that the hearing of its report be delayed from its scheduled date of Thursday to next Tuesday. He said, “We have deferred this to next Tuesday because we’re putting finishing touches to the budget. It is a lot of work. “Anything worth doing is worth doing well. So, the laying of the budget has been deferred to Tuesday, December 3.”
