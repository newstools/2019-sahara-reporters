The Department of State Services has claimed that it is ready to release pro-democracy campaigner and Publisher of Sahara Reporters, Omoyele Sowore, but that those coming forward are not qualified to collect him. The agency made the claim in a statement by its spokesperson, Peter Afunaya. Afunaya also denied that its operatives opened fire on protesters on Tuesday. He said, “While all those that have so far shown up are not directly concerned with the matter and therefore unqualified, many others have either chosen to grandstand or politicise it to achieve hidden interests. “In the last few days, the Service has continued to witness deliberate campaigns of calumny, threats and aspersions against it. “It will not, for any reason, join issues with its mudslingers. The media is called upon to be neutral and remain champions of the truth. “It is only appropriate that those who stood surety for Sowore present themselves and have him released to them.

It could not have done so.”
