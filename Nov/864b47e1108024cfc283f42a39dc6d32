Governor Darius Ishaku
Guardian Nigeria There are currently plans to impeach Speaker of Taraba State House of Assembly, Abel Diah. SaharaReporters can report authoritatively that members loyal to the state governor, Darius Ishaku, have perfected plans to storm the Assembly complex for the impeachment. Sources disclosed that Governor Ishaku has set aside N200m to effect the impeachment. It was also gathered that Majority Leader of the House of Assembly, Joseph Albasu Alkinjo, has been tipped to replace the Speaker. The plan to impeach Diah is being allegedly anchored on behalf of the governor by the duo of PDP Chairman in the state, Victor Bala, and Senator Joel Ikenya. It was further gathered that final meeting was held in the early hours of Friday at the residence of a former Speaker, Danlandi Gwampo. ''At about 3am on Friday, Victor Bala alongside SA Political, Abubakar Bawa, Joel Ikenya and others left Gwampo's house to see the governor at his official residence. "And the sum of N200m was handed over to them to commence the impeaching Diah. "The governor also approved that Alkinjo be made Speaker if the plan succeeds," a lawmaker, who craved anonymity said. Another lawmaker said he was offered N10m by agents of the governor to support the bid to impeach the Speaker. "In fact, they are moving about with cash, collating names but they donâ€™t have the majority as I speak with you. "Any attempt to impeach the Speaker with minority votes will spark violence in the state and I think the governor should avoid this," he said. When contacted, Bala Dan Abu, media aide to Governor Ishaku, denied that there was any such move by his boss.
