The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation has announced that it is expanding and integrating gas pipeline channels to match the country’s growing demand. Disclosing this during the NNPC Day at the just concluded 2019 Lagos International Trade Fair, Group Managing Director of the corporation, Mallam Mele Kyari, said that the organisation remains the chief enabler of the Nigerian economy. Represented by the Managing Director, National Engineering and Technical Company, Mrs Kate Iheme, Kyari pointed that with ongoing reforms, the NNPC was focused on transforming from a traditional oil and gas entity into an integrated energy outfit with interest in power generation and transmission. He said, “It is common knowledge that NNPC is expanding and integrating gas pipeline network systems to meet the unprecedented domestic gas demand nationwide. “Towards this end, significant progress had been recorded in the execution of some key on-going gas pipeline infrastructure projects like the Escravos Lagos Pipelines System (ELPs II) and the 0B3, among other gas infrastructure projects. “Before now, the corporation had also completed the repair of the vandalised 20-inch ELPS-A pipeline, thereby ensuring gas supply to gas-fired power plants and also supply into the West African Gas Pipeline.” The GMD further added that the NNPC downstream entities namely Petroleum Products Marketing Company, Nigerian Pipelines and Storage Company, NNPC Retail and NNPC Shipping, had contributed to the enhanced supply and distribution of petroleum products nationwide.
