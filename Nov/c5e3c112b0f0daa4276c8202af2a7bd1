  An Appeal Court sitting in Owerri on Saturday sacked ObinnaOnwubuariri, the member representing Isiala Mbano/Onuimo/Okigwefederal constituency of Imo in the House of representatives.The court also nullified the election of Uju Onwudiwe of the ActionAlliance (AA) representing Njaba state constituency and ordered freshelections in 12 polling units within 90 days.The PDP candidate, Charles Abia had challenged the victory of Onwudiwein the appeal court.The Chairman of the Panel, Justice R.N Pemu, who read the judgment,said that the election that brought Onwubuariri of the PeoplesDemocratic Party (PDP) to power on February 23 was not in tandem withthe electoral act of 2010, as amended.The appellate court said the lower court was right to have ordered afresh election in the federal constituency.Pemu said the petitioner, Miriam Onuoha of the All ProgressivesCongress (APC), was able to prove her allegations of over-voting,mutilation of figures and violence which marred the election.The court, therefore, ordered the Independent National ElectoralCommission (INEC) to withdraw the certificate of return it had earlierissued Onwubuariri and conduct a fresh election in the entire federalconstituency within 90 days.The tribunal had sacked Onwubuariri, but the lawmaker dissatisfiedwith the judgment appealed the judgment.
