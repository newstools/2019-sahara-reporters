  A dismissed police inspector, Ogunyemi Olalekan, has been remanded at the Ikoyi Prisons after his arraignment at an Ikeja High Court. Olalekan is being tried for the murder of Kolade Johnson, a 35-year-old man, at a viewing centre in Lagos. Olalekan and three other officers were on illegal duty when the officers shot sporadically in the act. Johnson was hit and died on the spot. Olalekan, 45, denied the charge of murder levelled against him during his arraignment. At the arraignment, the prosecution informed the court that Olalekan, who worked with the Special Anti-Cultism Squad, committed the offence at 5:10pm on March 31 at Onipetesi Estate, Mangoro, Lagos. “The former police inspector unlawfully killed Johnson by shooting him with an AK47 rifle in the lower abdomen. “The offence contravenes Section 223 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015,” said the prosecutor. Lagos State Director of Public Prosecution, Mr Yhaqub Oshoala, asked the court to continue to remand Olalekan at the facility. This case has been adjourned to January 15, 2020 for trial.
