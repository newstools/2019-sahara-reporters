SaharaReporters Media A gang of armed robbers have killed a security guard manning a Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation filling station in Akure, the Ondo State capital. One of the victim’s tooth was also removed. The guard, Moses, was killed around 1:30 am on Sunday when the station had shut down operations for the day. The robbers had stormed the gas station located on the Onyearugbulem Road at Shagari Village junction in the state city and overpowered the 27-year-old guard. SaharaReporters gathered that the guard was attacked with machete on the head before he was shot dead by the robbers. It is not clear whether the robbers carted away money from the facility but items included a CCTV camera were destroyed. A worker at the filling station, who spoke with SaharaReporters, said, “We just came to work as usual this morning only for us to see that some people had burgled our filling station and forcefully gained entry to the place. “We also noticed blood by the side of the station and saw the security guard (Moses) already dead, so we quickly raised the alarm. "The robbers broke the office of the manager and destroyed the things inside the place. During the process of looking for money, they ransacked everywhere in the office." A resident in the area, who also asked not to be named, added, "It was surprising for us to wake up this morning to find out that they robbed the NNPC filling station and killed one of the guards on duty. "None of us noticed that armed robbers were on operation here yesterday (Sunday) even to the extent that they had to break burglar-proof to gain entry.” A supervisor at the filling station told SaharaReportersthat the case had been reported to the police. Spokesperson for the police in Ondo, Femi Joseph, said investigation had begun into the incident when contacted on Monday.
