  President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered Nigeria's security forces on duty in Saturdayâ€™s governorship elections in Bayelsa and Kogi to use all legal means to stop ballot box snatchers and anyone fomenting trouble. The president, in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu in Abuja on Thursday, stated that on November 16, voters in the two states would decide who will be their governors for the next four years. Buhari said: "I call on voters in Bayelsa and Kogi to exercise their franchise in a peaceful and orderly manner and in line with the law in all situations. "Law enforcement officials must ensure that citizens are allowed to vote without harassment and intimidation and any attempt to steal or hijack ballots must be stopped using all legal means. "In all democratic elections, there are bound to be winners and losers and the elections in Bayelsa and Kogi will not be different. "All candidates should be ready to accept the outcomes and wherever they are dissatisfied, they should follow the due process of the law in seeking redress. There must not be a resort to self-help."
