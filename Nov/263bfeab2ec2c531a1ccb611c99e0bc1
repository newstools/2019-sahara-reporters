  The Court of Appeal on Tuesday affirmed the victory of Emeka Ihedioha as Imo State governor.Ihedioha, who represented the Peoples Democratic Party in the keenly contested March 9 governorship election in the state, is being challenged by candidates of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (Ifeanyi Ararume); Action Alliance (Uche Nwosu) and that of the All Progressive Congress (Hope Uzodinma). The appellants are asking the court to void the election of Ihedioha on grounds that he did not obtain the constitutional one quarter of votes in at least two-thirds of the 27 local government areas of the state, in line with Section 179 of the constitution. But in its ruling on Tuesday, the court held that Ihedioha fulfilled all requirements of the election and thereby affirmed his victory.
