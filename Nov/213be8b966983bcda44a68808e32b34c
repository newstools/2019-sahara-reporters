  Despite several irregularities that characterised Saturday’s governorship election in Kogi State, President Muhammadu Buhari described the emergence of Governor Yahaya Bello as a "victory well won". According to observers such as Amnesty International, the exercise in Kogi was marred with electoral violence, which resulted in the death of several persons. Prior to his re-election, Bello came under public scrutiny over his non-payment of salaries to government workers in the state. In his message on Twitter on Monday, Buhari said, “Congratulations to Governor Yahaya Bello on his re-election. “It was a race well run and a victory well won. I urge him to see his renewed mandate as another opportunity to build on the foundations already laid towards improving the lives of the people of Kogi State. "I commend INEC and security agencies for discharging their responsibilities under difficult conditions. “The violence that took place, and loss of lives, by thugs doing the bidding of their political sponsors, is condemnable. There is no room in our democracy for electoral violence. "Let me enjoin Governor Bello to imbibe the spirit of magnanimity in victory by extending a hand of partnership to opposition candidates, and also ask that all those dissatisfied with the outcome of the election should, in seeking redress, approach the courts."
