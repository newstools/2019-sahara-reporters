  Senator Dino Melaye on Wednesday called for the cancellation of the Kogi West Senatorial District election, which took place last Saturday, after visiting headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission in Abuja with 21 video clips containing evidences of irregularities. Melaye was received by INEC Secretary, Rose Orianran-Anthony, and National Commissioner/Chairman of its Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye. According to the outspoken lawmaker, the mandate given to him by the people of the district would be reclaimed through every legal means. In a petition to INEC, Melaye said, “Going by the spread of violence, gunshots and killings, disruption of the election, snatching of ballots, multiple thumb printing, several electoral malpractices, irregularities and total sabotage of the electoral process cut across all the seven local government areas in Kogi State which were demonstrated in the video footages attached herein, and the facts in paragraphs 1-5 above which reveals that the election was not conducted in Kogi State Senatorial District, in substantial compliance with the dictates of the Electoral Act, 2010 (as amended) as well as the requisite guidelines and regulations issued for the election, we urge the commission to cancel the entire election of Kogi West Senatorial District held on November 16 2019.” According to Okoye, who received the petition on behalf of the INEC Chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, INEC would immediately look into the petition.
