  Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has said that he plans to restrict movement of heavy-duty trucks in the metropolis during the day to ease traffic on the roads.The governor made the revelation on Monday at the Lagos House, Ikeja, when a team from the Nigerian Breweries Plc paid him a visit.Sanwo-Olu said that the government had been pushing the trailers off the whole corridor of Iganmu area to ensure that the journey towards Apapa remained free.He said, ”New policies are going to come out in the coming days on some regulations around movement of heavy duty trucks just so that we can manage what time of the day they all get to come in on the roads.”We cannot begin to imagine 30 to 50 trucks competing during work hours, and so we need to plan out the logistics around it, what time of the day they need to move.”It is more around how do we resolve traffic movement and traffic flow in all of the places and some very hard decision will be taken.”The issue is not building more roads, the issue is managing the ones that we currently have, and all of us using them efficiently and effectively.”The things that don’t need to move during the daytime, we can restrict them to night movement, so that they can free up traffic all around the place.”
