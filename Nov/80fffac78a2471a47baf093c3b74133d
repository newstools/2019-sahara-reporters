Governor of Bayelsa State, Seriake Dickson, has accused the General Officer Commanding 6th Division of the Nigerian Army, Sharham Jamil, of compromising security in favour of the All Progressives Congress. The governor said that even though Gen. Sarham had been transferred to the Nigerian Defence Academy, Kaduna, he refused to move and waited behind to supervise the use of the army to perpetrate electoral crimes and irregularities in the state's election. He noted that the GOC and the Brigade Commander of the Artillery Brigade attached soldiers to all APC leaders in all the wards, who they used to terrorise people from one polling unit to another. Dickson said, “I am accusing the GOC of the 6th Brigade, Major General Sharham Jamil, of delaying his handing over process after his transfer to the Nigerian Defence Academy, Kaduna, to perfect this illegal mission of rigging the election in Bayelsa. “He and the Brigade Commander of Artillery Brigade,  Elele, Lt Col Wase, are the ones attaching soldiers to all APC chieftains in every ward to rig the election in all the polling units. “The  President has to wake up and do something; this is not a democracy;  what is going on in Bayelsa in the name of an election is not a democracy."
