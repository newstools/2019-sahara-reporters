Faisal Maina  A Federal High Court in Abuja has granted bail to Faisal, the 20-year old son of former Chairman of defunct Pension Reform Task Team, Abdulrasheed Maina. Justice Okon Abang, in a ruling on Tuesday, granted Faisal bail in the sum of N600m and a surety in like sum. Justice Abang said the surety could be from any part of the country but must be a serving House of Representatives member, who must have landed property in Abuja. He said the surety must undertake to accompany the defendant to court at every proceeding till the end of the trial, and that should the surety be absent in court without any justifiable reason, the bail shall be revoked. Faisal was arrested by operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission in Abuja in October for attempting to shoot officials of the agency while arresting his father.
