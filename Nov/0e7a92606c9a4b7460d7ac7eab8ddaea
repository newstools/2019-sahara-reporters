  Ahead of Saturday’s governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states, President Muhammadu Buhari has called for fairness and transparency. In a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, Buhari called on contestants and their supporters to play by the rules. The statement reads, “On Saturday, November 16, voters in two states, Bayelsa and Kogi, will be left alone to decide who takes charge of the administration of their important states for the next four years. “President Muhammadu Buhari has made a strong demand for exemplary conduct of non-partisanship on the part of election and law enforcement officials in the two states. “All must carry out their functions with fairness and transparency; without let or hindrance and without fear or favour. “I call on voters in Bayelsa and Kogi states to exercise their franchise in a peaceful and orderly manner and in line with the law in all situations. “Law enforcement officials must ensure that citizens are allowed to vote without harassment and intimidation.” Meanwhile, the police has warned that anyone caught snatching ballot boxes during the election in both states would pay with their lives. Deputy Inspector-General of Police, Operation, AbdulMajeed Ali, gave the warning on Thursday while addressing journalists in Kogi. He said, “Anyone caught will not be spared and will not live to do that ever again. “We have enough personnel and capacity to deal with anyone that tries to foment trouble on Saturday. Just watch, if anyone tries to snatch ballot box on Saturday, he will pay dearly for it.”
