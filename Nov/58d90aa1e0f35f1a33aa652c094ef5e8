The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority has said that air passengers should expect delays, diversions and cancellation of flights where terminal visibility falls below the prescribed aerodrome operating minima during the Harmattan haze. The regulatory agency also directed airline operators and pilots in the country to beware of the Harmattan haze at this time of the year. General Manager, Public Affairs, NCAA, Mr Sam Adurogboye, said in a statement in Lagos. Adurogboye directed pilots and operators to note that air-to-ground visibility may be considerably reduced due to dust haze, aerodrome visibility may fall below the prescribed operating minima and in severe conditions, dust haze could blot out runways, markers and airfield lightings over wide areas making visual navigation extremely difficult or impossible during the period, which has already commenced in the country. It said that Harmattan haze could affect air safety in the sector. NCAA also said that it had sent out advisory circular on the change of the climate to airline operators, pilots and other concerned stakeholders to adhere strictly to international best standards. NCAA also cautioned Air Traffic Controllers, pilots and operators to exercise maximum restraint when severe weather condition was observed or forecast by Nimet, adding that flight crews and ATC shall ensure adherence to aerodrome weather minima within the period.
