The Delta State chapter of the All Progressives Congress has lambastedthe state governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, over plans to provide a $10-millioncounterpart fund for prospective investors towards the construction ofKwale Industrial Park in the state.Governor Okowa had on Tuesday in Shenyang, China his readiness toprovide $10-million.Reacting to Okowa's pronouncement, the state chapter of the APC, in astatement on Thursday, its Publicity Secretary, Sylvester Imonina,said, "The All Progressive Congress, Delta State and indeed allwell-meaning Deltans are disturbed of the move by the PDP ledgovernment in Delta State to enrich some persons whose stock in tradeis manipulations and underhand deals for the sake of their pockets. Aspart of their evil moves, they pretentiously came up with an idea ofestablishing an industrial park at Kwale."Just like the industrial park located in the oil city of Warri, whichis at between 60 to 70 percent completion stage but later abandoned,they refuse to disclose how much was budgeted for the proposedindustrial park in Kwale and how they intend bringing it to reality.“It is not too late for the state government to have a rethink. Thefact remains that government is a continuum and PDP led governmentought to see it from that angle. However, information available to ussays that the PDP-led government’s interest is how much money theycould pocket, instead of thinking of the common interest and good ofthe populace."Continuing, the statement said, "We state unequivocally that theproposed industrial park is a ploy by PDP-led government in Deltastate to further fritter away the resources of the state. We,therefore, call on the governor and his cronies to jettison thisselfish interest of theirs, for the interest of the masses."One of the reasons given for the abandonment of the Warri IndustrialPark by the PDP-led government is that there were/are limitedresources. Though discerning minds know that the excuse given by thestate was a ruse because it is a known fact that Delta State hasmultiple sources of income to wit, federal monthly allocations, hugeinternally generated revenues, ecological funds amongst others."Despite the huge revenues accruing to the state, the PDP-led DeltaState government complains of inadequate finances to enable it toexecute meaningful projects including Warri Industrial Park."
