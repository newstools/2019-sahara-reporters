And thatwas the day the primary would have held after he had announced that,Monday, October 1, 2018, being the actual date for the primary, was nomore feasible because he arrived Owerri at 2 pm, met with stakeholdersat 8 pm at police headquarters Owerri, which lasted till 11:35 pm.“And he went on a courtesy call to the then governor with his team at11:58 pm. And the courtesy call lingered until 1 am. They went back totheir hotel, only for him to abscond at 4 am, by his own account. Andthat was the genesis of the Imo APC problem. So, at what point was thebribe given?"At his press conference too, he declared someone the winner of aprimary he never conducted and the person happens to be Chief HopeUzodinma."The rest of the team, led by the committee’s Secretary, Barr. HenryIdahagbon, stayed behind and conducted the primary which Uche Nwosuwon."And after that, the national chairman of the party, Chief AdamsOshiomhole, disbanded the Gulak committee, having heard and known thedisgraceful script he (Gulak) had acted in Owerri."Then, why was his committee disbanded? However, at the end of theday, the party leadership settled for Chief Uzodinma, prompting Nwosuto settle for the ticket of Action Alliance."And now Gulak waited till more than a year after the ugly incident tocome up with his fictitious claim of $2-million bribe after he hadclaimed that he flee Owerri over kidnap attempt.“The truth is that Alhaji Gulak was sent to Owerri to ensure thedestruction of APC in Imo and by extension, in the South-East.”
