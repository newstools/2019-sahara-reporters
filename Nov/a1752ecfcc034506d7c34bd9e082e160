Former presidential candidate on the platform of KOWA, Prof Remi Sonaiya, has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to explain to the world what he stood to gain by continuing to keep pro-democracy campaigner and Publisher of Sahara Reporters, Omoyele Sowore, in detention. The Department of State Services has refused to release Sowore and Olawale Bakare despite two court orders directing the secret police to free them after meeting their bail conditions on both occasions. In a post on Twitter on Wednesday, Sonaiya, who was the only woman to contest the February 2019 presidential election in Nigeria, urged Buhari to end the violation of the country’s constitution by releasing Sowore. She said, “Dear President @MBuhari, good morning. A new day is an opportunity for a fresh perspective on things. “Deep within you, is it right for citizens to be shot at? If you freed Mr Sowore now, what would it detract from you? What could it add to you? Please reconsider. Have a good day.” On Tuesday, the DSS had violently dispersed activists that marched in front of its headquarters in Abuja demanding the release of Sowore and Bakare widely known as Mandate. Several journalists and observes were brutalised in the process by officials of the secret police, who also fired several gunshots to break the crowd. Sowore was arrested on August 3, 2019 for calling on Nigerians to take to the streets in peaceful demonstrations to demand a better country from the administration of President Buhari. The government has cooked up frivolous charges against him – among them insulting Buhari and trying to overthrow his administration – claims analysts around the world have described as laughable.
