"I learnt that the lady always abused them and also exposing some of their bad behaviours like the "runs" they do on campus. "They set the lady up yesterday and confronted her to begin to repeat those talks about them. "I am aware that the lady always calls them prostitutes and abuse them for sleeping with guys while leaving fake lives on campus. "These are things that angered those ladies and made them to report her to people closer to her but I guess she still didn't desist from exposing them. "So, they invited a guy claiming to be school father and he was the one using horse wipe to beat the young lady in the video you saw."
