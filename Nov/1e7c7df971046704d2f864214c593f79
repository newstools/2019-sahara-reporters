IEA's executive director, Fatih Birol
City A.M  The International Energy Agency said in its 2019 African Energy Outlook that 530 million persons in Sub-Saharan Africa will be left without electricity if the continent’s leaders do not change their electricity strategy. The agency said policy makers in the continent do not have a predetermined path towards providing power to all citizens. IEA boss, Fatih Birol, said the continent had the opportunity to become the fastest growing energy producing hub as a result of the number of natural and renewable resources within its atmosphere. He said the continent could achieve this with less carbon footprint than the developed world. Birol said, “Africa has a unique opportunity to pursue a much less carbon-intensive development path than many other parts of the world. “To achieve this, it has to take advantage of the huge potential that solar, wind, hydropower provide.”
