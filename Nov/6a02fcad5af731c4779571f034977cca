ChannelsTV Former Chairman of the defunct Pension Reform Task Team, Abdulrasheed Maina, on Monday arrived the Federal High Court, Abuja, with the aid of a walking stick. Maina, who came into Court 6, 2nd floor of the building at 9:40am, supported himself with the walking stick after he appeared in court in a wheelchair last week. The ex-pension reform boss, who is standing trial on alleged money laundering charge to the tune of over N2bn preferred against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, was dressed in a brown caftan with a matching cap, according to the News Agency of Nigeria. Justice Abang had on November 21 fixed Monday for hearing on the bail application and for the continuation of his trial. The judge, who accused the Nigerian Correctional Services of compounding the issue before the court for failing to produce a medical report on the health status of Maina days after the order to the effect was made by the court, ruled that Maina’s trial would be on a day-to-day basis in subsequent proceedings. His trial was stalled during the last adjourned date due to his worsening health condition. The EFCC had on October 25, arraigned Maina alongside his firm, Common Input Property and Investment Ltd, before Justice Abang. Though he pleaded not guilty to the 12-count charge, his trial has yet to make meaningful progress due to his health.
