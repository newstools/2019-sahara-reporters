 Nigeria's vocal pro-democracy activist, Omoyele Sowore, has been in the detention of Nigeria's secret police, the Department of State Services (DSS) for some 100 days in his quest for a better Nigeria in which respect for rule of law, equity and equality reign supreme. Sowore is also calling for a non-violent revolution to stamp corruption and bad governance out of Africa's most populous black nation. But for all that he is being arraigned in court on trumped-up charges of insulting President Muhammadu Buhari and money laundering, among others.
