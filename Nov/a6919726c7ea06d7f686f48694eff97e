  Villagers in Dan-Anacha under Gassol Local Government Area of Taraba State, have accused the Nigerian Army of taking sides in the Tiv/Jukun crisis in the area. A resident of the area, David Adeka'a, told SaharaReporters that violence erupted between Tiv and Jukun tribes over attempts to change the name of the village from Dan-Anacha to Kwararafa. He said, "The soldiers who had been stationed mainly in the Jukun dominated part of the town started shooting towards Tiv area. "The sporadic shooting by soldiers forced the villagers to return fire. "The attack destroyed the residence of Tiv community leader, Simon Eremtsa, and other houses belonging to Tiv people.” Chairman of Gassol LGA, Yahuza Yayau, confirmed the latest escalation of violence, saying houses were burnt on both sides of the divide. He however, said calm had returned to the community. When contacted, spokesperson for the Taraba State Police Command, David Misal, said he was not aware of the incident.
