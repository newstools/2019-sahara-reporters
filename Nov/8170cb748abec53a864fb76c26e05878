  The Court of Appeal has ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission to conduct a fresh election for the Tudunwada/Doguwa Federal Constituency seat at the House of Representatives. This came alongside the ruling that sacked Alhassan Ado Doguwa, a member of the All Progressive Congress representing Tudunwada/Doguwa Federal Constituency at the House of Representatives. According to Daily Nigerian, the court sitting in Kaduna in a unanimous ruling on Monday disagreed with the election tribunal and nullified same. The election petition had on September 5 dismissed a petition filed by the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Yusha’u Salisu, challenging the victory of Doguwa at the election. The tribunal had dismissed the petition of Salisu, holding that the candidate and his party failed to prove their case. However, the appeal court queried this conclusion. In a unanimous ruling, the court held that Doguwa’s election was frost with irregularities. The appellate court held that the entire election could not stand as INEC had omitted other parties from the final declaration of the result. The court said INEC made a substantial breach by writing the results of only two parties out of 53 parties that participated in the election in Form EC 8 (II) E. The court therefore ordered INEC to conduct a fresh election within 90 days in the entire constituency. Doguwa is the Majority Leader of the House and follows the Speaker and Deputy Speaker in ranking.
