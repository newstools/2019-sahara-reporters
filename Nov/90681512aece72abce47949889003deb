It was led by PrinceIwakura Tomomi; it was a team of statesmen, scholars, administrators,and students totaling 50 to the UK and America and find out why thesepeople are great."Many left behind to study; they studied the principles that madethese nations great and of course, the Japanese copy very well; theycopied the principles, and later Chinese copied from Japan too."What were those principles? Righteousness, integrity, forthrightness;Proverbs:14:34-righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a reproach toany people."This principle applies to a man or woman; because a nation is first aperson; Genesis 12:2, I will make you a great nation; firstrighteousness is the hallmark of the children of God."The second principle of the gospel which we need to practise isservice and diligence; the principle of the gospel is that thegreatest is the servant; the leader must be prepared to be the servantof all."Hard work/planning –the puritanical work ethic; this is the hallmarkof the Christian; the puritans were so hard-working; so diligent thathard work was named after them."Time consciousness, Ecclesiastes 3:1–to everything there is a season;a time for every purpose under heaven, preparedness.; we must beconscious of time."All these principles made those countries great because the believersin those countries took their responsibilities seriously."
