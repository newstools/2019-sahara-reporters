  Dino Melaye, candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the Kogi-West Senatorial District rerun, has rejected the results released by the Independent National Electoral Commission. INEC conducted a rerun of the senatorial election in the district and announced Smart Adeyemi, candidate of the All Progressives Congress as winner. The court had earlier declared the election conducted in the state as null and void while ordering the INEC to conduct a new election for the office. Dino, winner of the previous election, lost in the latest one, describing the results as “magic”. At a press conference in Abuja, Melaye accused Adeyemi and Governor Yahaya Bello of using violence, intimidation and inducement to frustrate the electorate in areas where he was popular. He said, “Three people were shot and two died; four people were killed in Lokoja; seven were killed in the eastern part of the state; this is the record we have so far, apart from those who sustained gunshot wounds. Melaye further alleged that the results of Iyara, Adeyemi’s hometown, were written while mayhem was unleashed on his hometown of Aiyetoro-Gbede which claimed the life of his nephew, Olajuwon. He said, “We are waiting to see what INEC will do. But I reject in totality these fictitious results. I, Dino Melaye, won that election in the afternoon and the APC won it at night.”
