 The House of Representatives on Tuesday faulted President Muhammadu Buhari’s treaty with Russia to bring in a firm from Moscow to revive Ajaokuta Steel Company. Nigeria’s lower legislative chamber adopted a motion by Uzoma Nkem-Obonta asking for details of the agreement to be made known to citizens. The lawmaker also reminded the presidency that section 12 of the constitution says no treaty with another country shall have the force of law except it had been enacted. Pursuant to the unanimous adoption of the motion, the House mandated the Committees on Steel; Treaties, Protocols and Agreements to meet with the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Olamilekan Adegbite, on the agreement. The committee was also asked to review all extant treaties entered into by the Federal Government and other countries to ensure conformity with the constitution. According to PUNCH, Nkem-Obonta reminded the lower chamber that PMB had declined assent to the Ajaokuta Steel Completion Fund Bill in 2018. The Abia State lawmaker noted that the bill had been re-gazette and had passed first reading in the lower house. The lawmaker also reminded other reps at plenary that the President had gone ahead to sign a deal with Russian President, Vladimir Putin, despite failing to sign the bill presented to it by the Eighth Assembly. The only detail available to the reps is that MetProm will undertake the reconstruction of the steel company, while the African Export Import Bank will oversee its financing.
