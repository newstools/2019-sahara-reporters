 Civil society organisations have called on President Muhammadu Buhari not to allow detained activists Omoyele Sowore, Olawale Bakare and Agba Jalingo  to spend New Year in custody. The groups made the appeal while submitting a petition to the Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party, Uche Secondus, in Abuja on Friday.The groups also condemned the silence and insensitivity of the party on the rising intolerance and disturbing cases of human rights violations in the country. The petition reads, "It is unfortunate that as the leading opposition party which regularly condemns the lawlessness of the ruling party at the centre, some of your governors, specifically Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State and Governor Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State have chosen the odious path of intolerance while embarking on coercive campaigns of arrest and arbitrary detention of social critics and political activists perceived as enemies for being critical of their governments."According to leader of the groups, Deji Adeyanju, the act of executive tyranny is a gross violation of the fundamental human rights of victims as guaranteed under Sections 39 and 35 of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended). He said the action of Governor Ayade and Governor Udom amounted to violation of the right of Jalingo and Itok  to free speech and press freedom. Adeyanju urged President Buhari to do everything within his power to release the the activists from detention.
