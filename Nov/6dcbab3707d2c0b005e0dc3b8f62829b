  The Federal Capital Territory Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps, Mr Ayuba Gora, has said that driving with the aid of Google map using mobile phones is a serious traffic offence.Gora said this at the inauguration of the 2019 Ember Months Campaign by Lugbe Unit Command of the FRSC in Abuja on Wednesday.According to him, the law forbids motorists from using mobile phones in any form while driving as it can lead to accident.He also informed motorists that the corps would soon begin massive enforcement of installation of speed limiting devices.The News Agency of Nigeria reports that Gora advised motorists, especially commercial vehicle operators, who had yet to install the device to do so to avoid sanction.He said, “We will embark on massive checks of vehicles without this device soon and arrest those that disconnect the devices from their vehicles.“It is very important that all vehicles have the device installed.“The required speed limit for commercial vehicles, even on the highways, should not exceed 90 km/hr for buses and taxis.“By doing this today, we are simply reminding motorists that they must drive with care and observe traffic rules and regulations in order to make the job very easy for all of us.“If you are arrested at this period, you will not just pay fines but must be taken for emotional evaluation test in the hospital to ascertain your mental fitness before we let you go."
