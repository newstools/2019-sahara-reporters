 A lawmaker representing Akure North and South at the National Assembly, Adedayo Omolafe, has kicked against the hate speech and social media bills before the federal legislature, saying if passed into law could set Nigeria back by many years. Omolafe, who described the two bills as an attempt to curb "dissenting voices" in the country, said he would not be a part of it. He spoke on Wednesday in statement in Akure, the state capital. He said, “I am compelled by my position as a representative of my people to say that I considered the bill a subtle attempt to turn the nation to a totalitarian state. "There is no gain saying that this bill is a gross violation of human right to freedom of speech and information. "I can therefore concur that the bill is ill motivated and a sharp target to silence constructive criticism which is the hallmark of democratic rule and good governance. "It is most unfortunate that the bill among other things intend to seek an establishment of a commission that will regulate hate speech without considering the fact that the country is currently faced with amalgams of challenges ranging from dwindling economy to dilapidating infrastructures among other things. "I want to put on record without mincing words that, I and good people of my constituency are opposed to this tyrannical bill in its entirety.”
