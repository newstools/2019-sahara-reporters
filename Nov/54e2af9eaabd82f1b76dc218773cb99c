President Muhammadu Buhari has said that his administration will forge a strong, united nation from the diverse religious and ethnic communities in the country. The President stated this when receiving the Tijjaniyya Muslim Religious Movement at the State House, Abuja, on Monday, according to the News Agency of Nigeria. Buhari lauded mutual understanding among the followers of the two major religions in the country, Islam and Christianity. He said, “It is generally said that differences divide people. "We in Nigeria understand that there is no way a misunderstanding can cause division among us. We are one people. “The requirements of our people, whatever religion they follow, and to whatever ethnic group they belong in Nigeria is the same. ‘‘They need security, education and participation in an inclusive economy. On this, we are being very fair to all Nigerians.”
