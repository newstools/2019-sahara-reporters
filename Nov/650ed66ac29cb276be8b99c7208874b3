  President Muhammadu Buhari has re-sent the 2016-2018 external borrowing plan to the National Assembly for its consideration and approval.Recall that Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, promised to assent to whatever requests Buhari brings before the National Assembly.The financial plan was approved by the Federal Executive Council in August 2016 and sent to the 8th Assembly in September 2016.The leadership of the federal parliament led by Senator Bukola Saraki and Yakubu Dogara invariably rejected the request in November 2016.Buhari had asked the 8th Assembly to approve plans to borrow $30bn abroad to fund infrastructure from 2016 to 2018.Lawan, who read the fresh request sent by Buhari on Thursday during plenary, did not give details of the executive communication.
