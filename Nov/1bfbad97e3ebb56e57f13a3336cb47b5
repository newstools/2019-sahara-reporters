  Borno State Governor, Babagana Zulum, says he is willing to negotiatewith some Twitter and Facebook users who are using his name on theirTwitter handles but warns that they have three days (from today) tocome forward to negotiate with him.Zulum’s special adviser on public relations and strategy said in astatement on Thursday (today) morning, "While Governor Babagana UmaraZulum recognizes and appreciates those who make selfless efforts topromote the activities of his administration through different mediaplatforms that include a microblogging and social networking site,Twitter, the manner in which some individuals or groups have goneabout creating and operating unauthorized personal accounts for thegovernor, is totally unacceptable."In the last six months, at least five accounts have been opened inthe governor’s name. The media office has made frantic efforts likesending them direct messages (DMs) to these accounts, particularly oneof such accounts that have generated more than 2,000 followers."However, the operators of these unauthorized accounts have refused toidentify themselves or come forward for discussions. At the moment,the governor has one authorized official account which is @GovBorno.There is also a recently created personal handle that is alreadygrowing followers."However, in order not to embarrass operators of any of the multipleunauthorized accounts, there will be a three-day delay in announcingthe name of the recently created authorized personal account."The delay is to give three days' room to operators of existingmultiple accounts to either close these accounts or in the case of theone with substantial followers, come forward for negotiations. Thenegotiations will, of course, include a critical review of the kindsof content shared by the account since it was created, the personsbeing followed by the account and those following it to possibly reacha win-win resolution."The statement noted further, "Operators of any of the multipleaccounts can, within three days, use the same unauthorized accounts tosend Direct Messages (DM) to any of the following twitter accounts:@GovBorno, @SpokesmanBornoG or @Bundi58. Although Emails may as a lastoption, be sent to govborno@gmail.com sending DM’s from theunauthorized accounts would be the best way to indicate that thesender exercises password control over the account.”The DM’s should contain the identity of those sending the messageswith the request for meeting at a venue and time that is convenientfor both parties."
