Nigeria-Seme border completely closed
AYODELE ADENIRAN An association of fish and coconut farmers has said that 900 of their trucks have been grounded at the Seme Border after paying excise duties of N4m each – N3.6bn in total. Chairman of the Association of Nigeria Licensed Customs Agents and Coconut/Fish Farmers Union, Samuel Igbowu, said the goods had been secured before the partial border closure was enforced, according to a report by PUNCH. Igbowu said the group of traders had lost over N5bn due to the government’s policy. He said, “A single truck paid over N4m as customs duty and we have over 900 trucks. “We are pleading to the government to please allow those that have paid duty to go in and deliver to our warehouses. "We are losing money day in day out. Bank loan is there and interest is accumulating on a daily basis.” The agric produce traders were protesting at the scene of a visit by a Federal Government delegation to the Seme Border. Igbowu added, "We have paid the normal customs duty and we have all the documents processed. "They have been trapped here for over three months now, they did not allow them to go in. "We cannot sell and we cannot return the money we borrowed.”
