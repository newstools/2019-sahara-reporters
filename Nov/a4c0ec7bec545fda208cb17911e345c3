At least 60 doctors have demanded urgent medical treatment for Wikileaks founder, Julian Assange, according to British media reports. The 48-year-old, who is currently in jail in Britain, urgently needs to be rushed to hospital for treatment or he may die in detention, according to a letter sent to British Home Secretary, Priti Patel. Both the physical and mental condition of Assange must be verified by experts, the letter said. “Were such urgent assessment and treatment not to take place, we have real concerns, on the evidence currently available, that Assange could die in prison,” the British media quoted the letter as saying. The letter published in the Guardian among other media outlets, was signed by doctors from the United States, Australia, Britain, Sweden, Italy, Germany, Sri Lanka and Poland. “The medical situation is thereby urgent. There is no time to lose,” they wrote. Assange is due to appear in court on February 25 to fight an extradition request from the US, which accuses him of helping whistleblower, Chelsea Manning, publish secret material on US military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
