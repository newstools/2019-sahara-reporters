  Aisha Buhari, Nigeria's First Lady, has called for stiff social media regulations in the country.She made her position known on Friday at the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs General Assembly and National Executive Council meeting at the National Mosque, Abuja, Daily Trust reports.Â According to her, since China with about 1.3 billion people can do so, there was nothing wrong for Nigeria to adopt such measure.She said, "On this issue of social media, you cannot just sit in the comfort of your house and tweet that the Vice President has resigned. It is a serious issue. "If China can control over 1.3bn people on social media, I see no reason why Nigeria cannot attempt controlling only 180m people."
