 A Kano State High Court has sacked four emirs appointed by governor of the state, Abdullahi Ganduje. SaharaReporters had exclusively reported how Ganduje planned and executed a three step plan to oust Emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi II, and disintegrate the Kano emirate, which had been around for centuries over a personal feud. Usman Na’Abba, the presiding judge, gave the order on Thursday, TheCable reports. The governor created four additional emirates in Kano in a bid to whittle down the influence of Sanusi, who challenged the action in court.
