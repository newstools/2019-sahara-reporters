A civil society group, Nigeria Democratic Liberty Forum, has called on Nigerians in the Diaspora especially those in the United States to sign a petition to their various lawmakers requesting the release of pro-democracy campaigner and Publisher of Sahara Reporters, Omoyele Sowore. Executive Director of NDLF, Bukola Oreofe, in a statement said that the current action by the administration of President Buhari was “reminiscent of the dark days of military dictatorship in Nigeria”. The statement reads, “Remember the age-long conviction that an injustice to one is an injustice to all. “If good men/women and advocates for justice do nothing, then we will witness the triumph and reign of evil. “Sowore counts on you to stand with him and demand respect for his fundamental human rights.”
