  Some Nigerians in the United Kingdom have protested in front of Abuja House, London, where President Muhammadu Buhari is believed to be receiving medical treatment to demand the immediate release of pro-democracy campaigner and Publisher of Sahara Reporters, Omoyele Sowore. Carrying placards bearing different inscriptions, the demonstrators also called for the release of Olawale Bakare, leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, and other political prisoners in the country. Despite demonstrating in front of the facility for hours, no Nigerian official came out to address them. President Buhariâ€™s administration has refused to release Sowore and Bakare despite two court orders directing the Department of State Services to free them. Sowore was arrested in Lagos on August 3, 2019 for calling on Nigerians to take to the streets in peaceful protests to demand a better country.
