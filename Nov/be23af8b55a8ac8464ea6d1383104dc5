  Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, has said that the role former President Goodluck Jonathan played in the just concluded Bayelsa elections was not the business of President Muhammadu Buhari. He said the claim that Buhari blackmailed Jonathan into supporting the candidate of the All Progressives Congress was false. Shehu said, “It just doesn’t make any sense. Our media really must learn to verify whatever they publish. “And people who make wild allegations during interviews should be made to produce the facts backing their claims by editors. ”A newspaper can be sued for granting space to people who belch false allegations against individuals with no proof.” Shehu said Jonathan had been out of power for almost five years without any previous allegations of government blackmail cropping up. He also noted that there were more than enough reasons for Jonathan to work against his party in the Bayelsa election without interference by President Buhari. Shehu added, “Anyone who has been following the politics of Bayelsa State should be aware of the sour relationship between Jonathan and the incumbent governor, Seriake Dickson. “That’s more than enough reason for the former President to decide to work against his party if indeed he did. “We really must stop this habit of blaming President Buhari for everything, including issues that are not his business
