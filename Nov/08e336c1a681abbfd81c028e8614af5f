Olisa Metuh
Sahara Reporters Media Justice Okon Abang of the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has fixed February 25, 2020, for the judgment in the criminal suit filed against former National Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party, Olisa Metu, and his company, Destra Investment Ltd. Metuh was arraigned by the Federal Government in 2016 over allegations of unlawfully receiving N400m from the office of the then National Security Adviser, Col Sambo Dasuki (retd). The money, the prosecution counsel said, was meant for the procurement of arms to curb insurgency in the North-East region but diverted to fund the media campaign of the PDP prior to the 2015 general election. Justice Abang fixed the judgment date on Tuesday after defence and prosecution counsels had adopted their final arguments.
