  A student of Bayero University, Kano, Yahuza Tijjani, has been remanded in prison custody by a magistrate court in the state over a Facebook post criticising a lawmaker. The second year student of the Department of Science and Technology Education has been held since September 30, 2019 after he was arrested by the police in Madobi Local Government Area, according to Premium Times. In the Facebook post, Tijjani in an apparent reference to the lawmaker, who he did not mention by name, said in Hausa, “You know he’s not well educated, as a result of which he doesn’t know how to calculate figures. “He said 1230, he later said 1500 and at the ending said 2000.” In another post, Tijjani said, “I pray to God almighty that the election petition tribunal (will) declare the election of state’s assembly member representing Madobi as inconclusive.” Tijjani has spent seven days at the Police ‘Zone 1’ regional headquarters in Kano and the State Criminal Investigation Department before he was sent to jail by the magistrate. The lawmaker, Kabiru Is’mail, and Tijjani are natives of Madobi Local Government Area. The move comes amidst widespread criticism of the Nigerian judiciary accused of working in cahoots with the executive arm of government to undermine tenets of democracy such as free speech.
