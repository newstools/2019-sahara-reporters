In what can be described as a huge swipe at members of Nigeria’s legislature, President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday said that there was nothing to show for the over N1trn spent on constituency projects over the last 10 years. According to Buhari, data obtained from Nigerians in rural communities across the country indicated that there was no impact of such projects by members of the National Assembly on the lives of the people. He said, “N1trn has been appropriated in the last 10 years for constituency projects but the impact can hardly be seen.” Speaking further, President Buhari called on the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission to go after contractors and their collaborators in government, who collected money for such projects but abandoned them. There have been series of debates in recent times over what Nigerian lawmakers take annually as funds for constituency projects. While some have argued that such funds allows lawmakers complement the efforts of their state governments in providing basic amenities, others continue to call for its abolition, arguing that it ends in the pockets of legislators, who either abandon projects midway or don’t embark on any at all.
