 Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the Kogi West Senatorial rerun election, Dino Melaye, on Wednesday visited the headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission in Abuja to submit a fresh petition and also give conditions for the supplementary poll in the district. In a copy of the petition dated November 27, 2019 submitted to the Chairman of INEC, Melaye called for the inclusion of the omitted areas earlier highlighted in the exercise. He stated that the data released by the commission for the conduct of the supplementary election did not reflect the total number of units affected by the pervasive malpractices and irregularities. The petition read in part, “The re-run notice issued by INEC covering the entire seven local government areas in Kogi West Senatorial District as well as the details contained in this petition, further amplify the pervasiveness of the malpractices and irregularities that marred the conduct of November 16, 2019 election. "However, in order to partially remedy this fundamental flaw, I request for the inclusion of the omitted areas earlier highlighted in the supplementary poll." Melaye accused the electoral body of overlooking many units, which ought to have been captured in the supplementary election. He maintained that any attempt to ignore the aforementioned conditions would undermine the integrity of the figures on which the proposed supplementary election would be based. He added, “The most charitable conclusion is that INEC failed to exercise the requisite diligence before rolling out the details of the proposed supplementary election.” The petition was received by Mr Jafaru Leko on behalf of INEC Chairman, Prof Mahmood Yukubu. INEC has fixed November 30, 2019 for the supplementary election in the state.
