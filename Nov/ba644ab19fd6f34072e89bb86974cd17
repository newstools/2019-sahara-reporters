Boris Johnson  Ahead of Britain’s snap elections, comments made by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in columns he wrote in the 1990’s have been dug up. One of such articles portrays Nigerians as persons who have an avid interest in money. Writing for the Independent In 1999, Johnson said, “All the young people I know – ie those under 30 – are just as avaricious as we flinty Thatcherite yuppies of the 1980s. "In fact, they have an almost Nigerian interest in money and gadgets of all kinds.” In previously unearthed slurs, Johnson described black people as ‘piccaninnies’ – a racial term describing persons of African descent as little, with a ‘water melon smile.’ He has also argued that Islam has caused the Muslim world to be “literally centuries behind.” The opposition Labour party, described Johnson’s past write ups as following a pattern of sexist and misogynistic words and behaviour.
