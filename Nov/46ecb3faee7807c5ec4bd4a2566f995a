Oil Pipeline in Nigeria
ThisDay Live Some angry youth at Ore under Odigbo Local Council Area of Ondo State on Friday protested their exclusion from the oil pipeline reticulation project in the community. The protesting youth, who took over the busy Ore-Benin Highway, chanted solidarity songs for several hours. Speaking during the demonstration, Mr Matthew Akinsola, Youth Leader of Odigbo Kingdom, said they were not carried along in the execution of the project. He said, "In any contract, there are some benefits meant for youths and the community but Zhakhem and Bradama companies are treating us like cowards. "There is a percentage they should give us and we are supposed to be part of the workforce. "They have not employed any youth here and they came with all their workers to our land." According to him, when Shimat company was handling the reticulation project, many indigenes were employed and the community benefitted. Akinsola called on President Muhammad Buhari to intervene in the process. Akindele Olatunja, a representative of the Odigbo communities, explained that he signed an undertaking with all stakeholders in the area that they should not foment trouble. He said, "Why should a contractor complete his job without being paid since 2016? "To worsen the matter, we have been sidelined having even signed an undertaking with youths, community to allow peace to reign. "I want to appeal to President Buhari to get involved in this matter because we are ready to stop the job until we are settled."
