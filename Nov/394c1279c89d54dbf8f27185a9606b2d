There was drama on Tuesday following the presentation of the 2019/2020 budget of the Niger Delta Development Commission to the Senate by President Muhammadu Buhari. Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, read President Buhari’s letter during plenary. However, Minority Leader of the Senate, Enyinnaya Abaribe, coming under order 43 of the Senate Standing Orders on personal explanation, drew the Senate’s attention to the fact that the members of the governing board of the agency recently cleared by the Senate were yet to be sworn-in. Abaribe wondered, who will appear before the relevant committees of the Senate to defend the proposals, a report by ThisDay, said. Abaribe said, “We just heard from you (Senate President) the communication from Mr President which relates to the presentation of the NDDC’s budget for approval. “Of course, what it will mean is that the budget will go to the relevant committee of Appropriation and the NDDC Committee and some persons will come to defend the budget. “Having regard to the fact that this Senate has confirmed members of the board of the NDDC and they are yet to resume office, I fear that we may run into a problem of delayed budget again since nobody will come to defend this budget. “So, to prevent a delayed budget for the NDDC that is helping the region for development, it would be better for us to prevent this issue from coming and let the needful be done.” Lawan sustained Abaribe’s point of order and urged the executive to do the right thing so that the right persons can come and defend the NDDC’s budget.
