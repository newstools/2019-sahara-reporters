A statement from the corporation, which disclosed this, stated that the addition of the AfDB as a shareholder and development finance institution member of the corporation complements its strategy of addressing Africa’s infrastructure deficit with the AfDB’s stated mission to help reduce poverty, improve living conditions for Africans and mobilise resources for the continent’s economic and social development.
