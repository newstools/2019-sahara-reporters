  Zamfara State House of Assembly has repealed the law mandating the state government to pay pension and other entitlements to former governors and deputies, as well as those of Speakers and their deputies. Presenting the bill before the House on Tuesday, House leader, Faruk Dosara, urged his colleagues to as a matter of urgency, consider the repeal of the law, which provided jumbo pay for former political leaders in the state to the detriment of retired civil servants. Dosara said the category of past leaders were collecting over N700m annually, which he said the present state economy could not accommodate for now. Seconding the motion, Tukur Tudu said the abolition of the law was necessary, arguing that “it is detrimental to the socio-economic wellbeing of our people”. After deliberations and contributions by House members, the Speaker, Nasiru Magarya, ordered the clerk of the House to give the bill first and second reading. The bill has now been passed into law and would be sent to the governor for assent. With this development, all past political leaders in the state will no longer enjoy any entitlements unless those prescribed by the National Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission, a report by PUNCH said.
