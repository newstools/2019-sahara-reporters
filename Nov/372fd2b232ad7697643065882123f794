REUTERS  Nearly 500 men and boys were rescued in a building in Kaduna where it was reported that some of the detainees were sexually abused, tortured and starved, according to the police. Not so long, some 300 young men were freed in a school in Daura, hometown of President Muhammadu Buhari in Kastina State, where children and students had been chained, hung from ceiling and beaten. However, this has prompted the police to launch a crackdown on 'torture houses', informal Islamic schools, and rehabilitation centres and with this, nearly 1,500 people have been freed so far. Timeline of events since the crackdown started September 26, 2019: More than 300 boys and men, some as young as five, were rescued in a raid on a building that purported to be an Islamic school in Kaduna.
