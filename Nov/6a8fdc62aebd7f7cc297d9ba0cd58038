  The Academic Staff Union of Universities, University of Port Harcourt Branch, has said that its members were ready to forfeit their December salaries to stop the registration for the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System.Chairman of the branch of ASUU, Dr Austen Sado, made the comments in an interview with PUNCH.He said members of the union were willing and ready to make sacrifices in order to stop the violation of the university laws through IPPIS.He said, "On IPIIS, as a union, ASUU has taken a decision, both the branch and national, that IPPIS is a violation of the law. It will not collaborate with anybody, who wishes to violate the laws of the land. We are resolute on this.“Again, any attempt to forcefully enrol our members will be achieved by pyrrhic victory; it will be a victory achieved at a very high expense.“If the December salary is the sacrifice, we are going to stop this violation of the university law and autonomy, we are prepared to make it."
