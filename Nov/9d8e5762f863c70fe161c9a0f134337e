President of the Nigeria Football Federation, Amaju Pinnick, has said that his team had always maintained their innocence at the organisation. Pinnick made the disclosure on Monday while appearing as guest on Channels Television’sSunrise Daily. The NFF President said his team had also always laid its books bare for everyone to see. His statement comes few days after a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja discharged and acquitted him of charges bordering on fraud to the tune of $8.4m and N4bn. Pinnick and other executives of the NFF were charged on 16 counts of corruption and misappropriation of the said sums from the 2014 FIFA Grant, as well as for conflict of interest and non-declaration of assets by the defunct Special Presidential Investigation Panel headed by Okon Obono-Obla.
