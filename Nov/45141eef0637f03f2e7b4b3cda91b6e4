Abel Diah
ChannelsTV Moves to impeach the Speaker of Taraba State House of Assembly, Abel Diah, has gained momentum. SaharaReporters has learnt that some lawmakers in the state were escorted Friday afternoon by heavily armed security men to Wukari town, about 200 kilometres from Jalingo, the capital. The move, it was gathered, became necessary because supporters of the Speaker had besieged the House of Assembly premises to prevent the impeachment. However, reports indicates that only nine members had allegedly signed to go to Wukari and that they had not formed the required 2/3 of 24 members to effect an impeachment. Our correspondent also gathered that a delegation from Gembu, hometown of the embattled Speaker, was discussing with Governor Darius Ishaku hoping to avert the impeachment.
