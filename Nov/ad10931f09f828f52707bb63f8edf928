Rights lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN), has written to the Economic Community of West African States to request an end to the smuggling of goods from Benin Republic into Nigeria. He called on the commission to prevail on the Nigerian Government to end the illegal closure of land borders without any further delay.

The letter read in part, “The commission should fast-track the deployment of the Task Force on Free Movement of Goods and Persons to arrest and prosecute the powerful smugglers operating in Benin and Nigeria with the connivance of a few unscrupulous customs officials.
