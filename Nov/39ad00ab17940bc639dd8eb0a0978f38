 A member of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Adebisi Yusuf, has condemned the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari over its continued disregard court orders. The lawmaker, who represents Alimosho Local Government Area at the Assembly, said this while addressing persons protesting against the proposed hate speech bill. Yusuf, while scolding the Department of State Services for the illegal detention of Omoyele Sowore, said that no sensible government should disobey a court order. Yusuf said, “No reasonable person will entertain the  suppression of law anywhere. “I’m quite sure our government will not condone any harassment of anybody." Activists stormed the state’s House of Assembly at Alausa in Ikeja, the capital, to express their displeasure with the proposed bill. According to them, the bill was a subtle attempt to turn Nigeria into a totalitarian state under President Buhari’s government. The bill, which was sponsored by Deputy Chief Whip of the Senate, Sabi Abdullahi, among other penalties seeks death for those the government deems guilty of hate speech.
