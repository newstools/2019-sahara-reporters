 A self-acclaimed pastor,  Sunday Egbo, has confessed to raping a member of his church, who refused to have sexual intercourse with him. The man made the confession while being paraded by the Enugu State Police Command on Tuesday. The police said a coffin and multiple female pants were recovered from Egbo’s house. It was gathered that the victim had gone for prayers, during which the pastor forcefully had carnal knowledge of her. According to the state’s Commissioner of Police, the pastor took the woman to his room, brought out a magic stone and threatened to kill her if she raised the alarm. He further stated that after the rape, he seized her pant; brazier and brought a small bottle and wanted to insert it into her private part but she struggled and ran out naked. Egbo said, “I wanted to have sex with her but she refused. So, I raped her. “I paid a native doctor N200,000, to get the coffin and flute. "He told me to do certain things, after which I will get a Ghana-must-go bag full of money in my room. “But after two weeks, the money did not come as the native doctor told me. “I believe I was deceived. So, I’m advising other men of God to follow the ways of God. There is no need seeking power and favour in the wrong ways. “I also advise Nigerians to be mindful of the places they go for prayers.”
