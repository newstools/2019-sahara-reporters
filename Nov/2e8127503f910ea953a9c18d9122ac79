  The Nigerian Senate has distanced itself from the proposed legislation on hate speech, which passed first reading last week. The bill had been met with widespread criticism from citizens, who claimed it was aimed at gagging the opposition and dissenting voices. Acting spokesperson for the Senate, Godiya Akwashiki, told journalists in Abuja on Monday that the bill was not the idea of the Senate but that of the Deputy Chief Whip, Sabi Abdullahi. According to Akwashiki, who knocked the Peoples Democratic Party for claiming that the bill was part of a plot to clear the way for a third term ambition of President Muhammadu Buhari, the outcome of the proposed bill will be determined by the entire upper legislative arm of government.
