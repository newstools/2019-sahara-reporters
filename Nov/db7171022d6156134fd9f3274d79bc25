The Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria has asked Nigerians to embark on a two-day “prayer of warfare” against the conference on witchcraft being organised by the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. The conference on witchcraft organised by the B.I.C Ijomah Centre for Policy and Research in UNN, will take place between November 26 and November 27. Godwin Madu, Chairman of PFN, on in a statement on Sunday called for the cancellation of the conference. Madu said, “We cannot fold our arms and watch our future dragged into what will not give God glory. “To this end, the church in Enugu has declared a two-day prayer of warfare. We must not allow this at a time like this, as we have had enough of ungodly activities in the country already. “The church should pray against those sponsoring evil in the state. “Enugu State is in the hands of God, we will not hand it over to witches.”
