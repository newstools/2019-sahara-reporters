 Less than a week after a court ordered that the Social Democratic Party show be allowed to participate in 2019 Kogi governorship election, hoodlums allegedly loyal to the All Progressives Congress have attacked the party secretariat in the state, setting it on fire. It was gathered that the hoodlums invaded the party secretariat in Lokoja, the capital, around 2:00am in the early hours of Monday and destroyed campaign materials in the building. It was also alleged that posters at the party secretariat were destroyed and replaced with the posters of the candidate of APC, Governor Yahaya Bello. SDP governorship candidate in the state, Natasha Akpoti, during her visit to the party secretariat revealed that her office in Lokoja was also attacked by some gunmen suspected to be supporters of the APC, burning down the building. She said, “Is this how we are going to sit down and watch the illegality of APC in Kogi State?
